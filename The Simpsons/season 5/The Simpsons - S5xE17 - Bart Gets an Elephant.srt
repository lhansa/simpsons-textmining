your mailbox. Okay.

Yeah, right, buddy.

This is the moment

Many of you thought
it would never happen...

340
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:04,838
but I insisted we spend two hours
every morning training for it.

You all thought I was mad.

to the precious ivory.

And, of course, your lovable pet,
who it's connected to.

Dad, I can't let you sell him.
Stampy and I are friends. Ow!

00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:12,113
Anyway, I want him to go
to that animal refuge.

Forget it! That elephant
cost me thousands of dollars.

Dad, how would you like
to be sold to an ivory dealer?

00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:21,352
- I'd like it fine.
- Even if he killed you...

363

into piano keys?

00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:27,927
Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't
like that, to be part of the music scene?

- No, that's okay.

I'm pretty sure
I can struggle my way out.

368
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:39,139
First, I'll just reach in
and pull my legs out.
