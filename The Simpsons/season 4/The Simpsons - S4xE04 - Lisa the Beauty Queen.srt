against the evils in society...

344
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:10,000
from dog-napping to cigarettes.

[Lisa]
Before I sing the national anthem...

346
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,781
I'd like to say that college football...

347
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:23,874
diverts funds badly needed
for education and the arts.

348
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,588
- Is that true?
- Let's get 'em!

352
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,066
Gentlemen, we need
to get Lisa Simpson out...

353
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,068
and Amber Dempsey back in.

354
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,970
But this glorified, crossing-guard-of-a-police
Chief won't get off his big fat can.

355
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:47,837
Is it okay if I open these potato chips?

- [ Groans ]
- Gentlemen, our prayers have been answered.

357
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:55,242
Take a look at our
Little Miss Springfield's pageant application.

358
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:00,347
Roxy, bring in a bottle of champagne.

359
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:03,356
Yeah, and some dip
for these chips or somethin'.

360
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,053
Lisa Simpson is no longer
Little Miss Springfield.

361
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,995
She was stripped of her crown
in a ceremony earlier today.

362
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:15,067
Well, that's obviously
the wrong footage.

363
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:20,608
Uh, but it does seem the father of
the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson...

364
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:23,007
filled out the pageant
application incorrectly.

365
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:27,241
In the area under "Do not write
in this space," he wrote, "Okay."

366
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:29,977
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be queen.

367
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:34,112
- You must hate me.
- Dad, do you remember why
you entered me in that pageant?

368
00:21:34,222 --> 00:21:36,213
- I don't know. Was I drunk?
- Possibly.

369
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:40,988
But the point is, you wanted me
to feel better about myself, and I do.

370
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:42,723
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

371
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:45,322
Will you remember this
the next time I wreck your life?

372
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:47,402
It's a deal.

373
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:53,631
And now, my exclusive interview
with His Holiness, Pope John Paul I.

374

That's it.
I cannot work under these conditions.

If anybody wants me,
I'll be downstairs at McDougal's.
