- Would you like some vodka with that?
- Oh, what the hell. Sure.

330
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:31,647
Doctor, what's wrong?
Don't you know where to make the incision?

331
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:34,315
All right, Nick.
Don't panic.

332
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,552
Think back to med school.

333
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:42,358
Seriously, baby.
I can prescribe anything I want.

334
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,361
I know I'm supposed to cut something,
but what? And where?

00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:52,836
Hey! The incision
in the coronary artery...

336
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:55,537
must be made
below the blockage!

337
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:59,377
- Below!
- Thanks, little girl!

Goodnews!
The operation was a complete success.

Oh, that's wonderful!
Mmm!

Dr. Nick Riviera,
remember me?

344
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,449
Well if it isn't
my old friend Mr. McGreg...

345
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:38,646
with a leg for an arm
and an arm for a leg.

346
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,650
All right, Dad!
