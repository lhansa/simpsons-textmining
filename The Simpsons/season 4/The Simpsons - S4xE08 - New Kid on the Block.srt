00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:46,591
If I ever find out who you are, I'm gonna
shove a sausage down your throat...

333
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:48,595
and stick starving dogs
in your butt!

334
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:52,690
My name is Jimbo Jones,
and I live at 1 094 Evergreen Terrace.

335
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:56,259
Aha! Big mistake, pal!

336
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:59,238
Ho-ho!
I knew he'd slip up sooner or later.

337
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:02,538
Ah, yes.
Rusty and dull.

338
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:06,171
Barney, don't steal any beer
while I'm gone.

339
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:09,876
What kind of pathetic drunk
Do you take me for?

340
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:13,113
[ Gasps ]
Somebody spilled beer in this ashtray.

341
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,121
[ Slurps Loudly]
Ahh.

342
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:19,853
[ Grunting, Laughing Sinisterly]

343
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:23,192
Let's see. Where is that map?
Evergreen Terrace.

344
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:26,495
There it is-- F-5.
[Laughing Continues]

345
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:34,166
I don't believe it.
Now my pants are chafin' me.

346
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:38,574
[ Panting ]
All right, who's Jimbo Jones?

347
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,707
- I am.
- You just made your second mistake, buddy boy!

348
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,650
Please, dude, don't hurt me.
Oh, man.

349
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:48,222
[ Sobbing ]

350
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:52,384
- That's your outlaw?
- I wasn't really gonna kill ya.
I was just gonna cut ya.

351
00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:54,928
[ Sobbing Continues ]

352
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,659
Ah, forget it. Ouch!
I better go check on Barney.

353
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,834
Uh-oh.
My heart just stopped.

354
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:09,075
Ah, there it goes.

355
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:13,614
[ Grunting, Laughing Sinisterly]

356
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:16,616
- [Thump]
- Ow! Stupid wishing well!

357
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:20,051
Jimbo, I don't think
we should see each other anymore.

358
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,055
You're just not the guy
I thought you were.

359
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:26,059
[ Sniffles ]
Can I have my shirt back?

360
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:29,096
[ Blowing Nose ]

361
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,290
Well, Bart,
you were right about him.

362
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:34,630
As usual, a knife-wielding maniac
has shown us the way.

363
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:38,968
You know, if you were only old enough
to grow a bad teenage mustache...

364
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:43,306
- I'd go out with you in a second.
- Wow.

365
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:47,313
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Miss Tinkle, first name...

369
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:57,491
All right, everybody,
put down your glasses.
