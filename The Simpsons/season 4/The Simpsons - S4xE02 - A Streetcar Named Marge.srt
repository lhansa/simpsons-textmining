337
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:07,653
- You know which one I mean. You played her.
- Blanche.

338
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:10,163
Yeah.
How Blanche was sad.

339
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:13,098
And how that guy Stanley
should have been nice to her.

340
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,862
Yeah?
Go on.

341
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,870
I mean,
it made me feel bad.

342
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:19,600
The poor thing ends up being
hauled to the nuthouse...

343
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,974
when all she needed was for that big slob
to show her some respect.

344
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,979
Well, at least that's
what I thought.

345
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:28,845
I have a history of missing
the point of stuff like this.

346
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,316
No, Homer,
you got it just right.

347
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:35,487
Hey, you know,
I'm a lot like that guy.

348
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,424
- Really?
- Yeah, like when I pick my teeth
with the mail and stuff.

349
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:42,053
Well, maybe just a little.

350
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,469
- [ People Chattering ]
- Shh!
