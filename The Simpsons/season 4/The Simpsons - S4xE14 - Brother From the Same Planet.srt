- [ Bones Cracking ]
- This is even more painful than it looks.

345
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,997
This is all my fault, Dad.

346
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:52,372
I didn't want you
to get hurt.

347
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,707
Now I need to find
another little brother.

348
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:57,303
And I need to find
another big brother.

349
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,940
My car's gonna feel
so empty on the ride home.

350
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,452
And me,
I have no ride at all.

351
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:07,183
I already bought a giant ham for dinner.
It's gonna go to waste.

352
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:10,318
Don't talk about food.
I'm so hungry.

353
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:12,328
- Well, good-bye.
- Well, good-bye.

354
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,227
Wait. I've got an idea.

355
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:16,129
- An idea?
- Huh?

356
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:34,278
- Another beer, Dad?
- Thanks, son.

357
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:36,979
Dad, remember when Tom
had you in that headlock...

358
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,113
and you screamed,
"I'm a hemophiliac..."

359
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:41,248
and when he let you go
you kicked him in the back?

360
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,917
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah?

361
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:44,756
Will you teach me
how to do that?

362
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:46,853
Sure, boy.

363
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:49,525
First, you gotta
shriek like a woman.

364
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:52,728
And keep sobbing
till he turns away in disgust.

365
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:56,705
That's when it's time
to kick some back.

366
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:59,299
-And then when he's lying out on the ground--
- Yeah?

367
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,139
- Kick him in the ribs.
- Yeah?

368
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:03,236
-Step on his neck.
- Yeah?

369
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:06,918
-And run like hell.
