[ Sighs ]
It's not their fault.

359
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,848
I think their father
is missing a chromosome.

I can't. The beans will burn.

How do you do it, Homer?

379
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:23,667
You take an ordinary bed sheet,
fold it around like this--

380
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:27,108
No. I mean raising kids.

381
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:30,237
I just couldn't cut it today.

382
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:32,373
All I wanted was
a little version of me...

383
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:35,008
that I could
hold in my arms.

384

Oh, JubJub.

385
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:44,287
