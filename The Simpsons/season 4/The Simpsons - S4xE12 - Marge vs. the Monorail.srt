332
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,913
Homer, there's a man here
who thinks he can help you.

333
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,988
- Batman?
- No, he's a scientist.

334
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:58,956
- Batman's a scientist.
- It's not Batman!

335
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,357
I think I have a way
to stop the train.

336
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,429
You need to find
an anchor of some sort.

337
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,801
Think harder, Homer.

338
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:12,804
[ Gasps ]

339
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,410
I'll take that.

340
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:32,453
- Uh, Dad?
- [ Screams ]

341
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:52,670
Now, separating Siamese twins
is a long and costly procedure.

342
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,839
[ Together]
Huh?

343
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,916
Arr!
Ya call that an anchor?

344
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:16,834
Huh?

345
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:21,872
Donuts.
Is there anything they can't do?

346
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:25,206
- Dad, you're a hero.
- Yes, son.

347
00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:28,769
I'm the best
mono-thingy guy there ever was.

348
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:31,214
[Cheering]

349
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:33,376
Well, my work is done here.

350
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:35,386
What do you mean,
Your work is done?

351
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:37,513
- You didn't do anything.
- [ Chuckles ]

352
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:40,354
Didn't I?

353
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,930
[Marge]
And that was the only folly...

354
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:50,230
the people of Springfield
ever embarked upon...

355
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:53,567
except for
the Popsicle stick skyscraper...

356
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:58,902
and the 50-foot magnifying glass...

357
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:01,480
and that escalator to nowhere.

358
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,173
Whoa!

359
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:05,478
Aah!

360
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,485
Aah!

361
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:10,590
- Whoa!
- Aah!

362
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,762
- [ People Chattering ]
- Shh!
