2
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:21,297
Whoops.

3
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:24,000
Whoops.
Whoops.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,669
This is gonna be the best
birthday breakfast Mom ever had.

5
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:29,005
Hey, Lis.
You think that's enough for her?

6
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,307
Maybe one more.

7
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:34,677
- I hope she likes
the presents we got her.
- She'll like mine.

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,614
Who wouldn't like a bottle
of real French perfume
all the way from gay Paree?

9
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:40,683
Four bucks, plus tax.

10
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:43,119
I think she's going to like
my handmade birthday card better.

11
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:47,290
Oh, big deal. Dry macaroni,
spray paint and glue. Whoopie.

12
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,732
Dibs. First dibs.
I get to lick the beaters.

13
00:00:55,732 --> 00:01:00,737
Ow! Ow! Ow! Litha, my "ongue"
is "uck" in the "eaters." My "ongue"!

14
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:09,045
Happy birthday!

15
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,114
Huh? What?

16
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:13,917
- Here's your birthday breakfast.
- Oh!

17
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:16,986
Isn't this nice?

18
00:01:16,986 --> 00:01:19,823
- My birthday? It's my birthday?
- No!

19
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:22,425
What did I get?
I love birthdays.

20
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:25,729
- No, Homer, it's mine.
- You don't even know
your own wife's birthday?

21
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:29,299
Well, of course I know.
Sure.

22
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:31,735
You really thought
I forgot, didn't you?

23
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,004
- Oh, right. What did you get her, Dad?
- What did you get?

24
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:37,941
Uh, well,
a very thoughtful gift.

25
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,043
But it's a surprise.

26
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:42,045
You know, it's such
a beautiful morning,

27
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:45,115
I think I'll take a little stroll
around the block.

28
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,323
- I think he forgot, Mom.
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:57,227 --> 00:02:00,864
Oh, no. Come on.
Come on. Open up!

30
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,866
Good morning, consumers.

31
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,736
The Springfield Mall is now open
for your spending needs.

32
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,741
Hmm? Uh... no.

33
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:13,243
Too salty.

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,445
Um... nah.

35
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,447
Hmm? Nah, too corny.

36
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:20,817
Too exciting.

37
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:23,921
Patty, he's out
buying me something right now.

38
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:28,559
Oh, Marge.
He never gets anything you want.
He always gets something for himself.

39
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,628
- The tackle box.
- Remember when he got you
the tackle box?

40
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:36,133
- And Connie Chung.
- And when he surprised you
with the Connie Chung calendar?

41
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,635
I'm sure he doesn't
do it deliberately.

42
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:42,373
Hmm. Hmm!

43
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:46,443
Well, Homer and I had a lovely
dining experience at Chez Pierre.

44
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:48,445
Or the Rusty Barnacle
is nice.

45
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:50,447
No, no, no.

46
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:53,851
We wanna take you someplace fun--
The Singing Sirloin.

47
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:57,454
The place where the waiters sing.

48
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:02,126
- Homer?
- Be right there.

49
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:09,066
Homer, we're having dinner tonight
at The Singing Sirloin.

50
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:12,870
That sounds delightful.
Just you and me and the balladeers.

51
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:14,872
- And the kids.
- Fair enough.

52
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:17,575
- And my sisters.
- Doh!

53
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,384
How we danced
on the night we were wed

54
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:28,352
Havin' my baby

55
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:31,555
What a lovely way to say
how much you love me

56
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:35,693
Nearer my God to thee

57
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,998
Nearer to thee

58
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,936
Oh, perfume!

59
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:48,072
Whoa! Hmm.
Thank you, Bart.

60
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:50,875
- You're welcome, Mom.
- 34 years old.

61
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:54,245
Time enough to start over
with a new man.

62
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:56,948
- Someone who eats
with his mouth shut.
- What's that, Patty?

63
00:03:56,948 --> 00:03:59,250
Nothing.
Finish your steak.

64
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:01,886
- Look at him wolfdown
that gristle.
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,888
It's an accident waiting to happen.

66
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:05,890
Do you know
the Heimlich Maneuver?

67
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,992
- No.
- Good.

68
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:12,497
I think she likes
my present better.

69
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:14,699
- Does not. Does not. Does not.
- Does too. Does too.

70
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:17,502
Then how come she's not
putting on any of your perfume?

71
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:19,504
Yeah.
Hey, Mom.

72
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,173
How come you're not putting on
any of my perfume?

73
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,676
Mm.

74
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,946
Well, I'm saving it
for a special occasion.

75
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,315
What the hell are you talking about?
There's gallons of it!

76
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:33,385
- Bart!
- But this occasion
is already so special.

77
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:35,387
If we made it
any more special,

78
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:37,589
we might end up
making it less special.

79
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,492
- Gotcha. Told ya she liked mine better.
- Oh, brother!

80
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,594
Hold on.
Hold on now.

81
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:45,897
Your mother hasn't opened
my present yet.

82
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:48,700
Happy birthday to you

83
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,702
Happy birthday to you

84
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:54,506
Happy 34th birthday,
Mrs. Homer Simpson

85
00:04:54,573 --> 00:05:00,312
Happy birthday to you

86
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:07,319
Oh. Don't worry.
This frosting will come right off.

87
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,321
Beauty, isn't she?

88
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:13,091
It's hard for me to judge
since I've never bowled in my life!

89
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:16,194
Well, if you don't want it,
I know someone who does.

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,002
You always say we should talk.

91
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:26,205
I'm talking right now,
as a matter of fact.

92
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,407
But I'm going to stop
in a second,

93
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,076
so please, say something back,
Marge, please?

94
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:33,312
I'm gonna stop talking...
now.

95
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:36,882
You bought that bowling ball
for you, not for me.

96
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:40,085
- What? No.
- The holes were drilled
for your fingers.

97
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:42,121
I wanted to surprise you.

98
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,690
I couldn't very well chop your hand off
and bring it to the store.

99
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:47,026
You never intended for me
to use that ball.

100
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,028
If that's how you feel,
I'll take it back.

101
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:51,630
You can't take it back.
You had your name engraved on it!

102
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:54,199
- So you'd know it was from me!
- Homer,

103
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,835
I'm keeping the ball...
for myself!

104
00:05:56,835 --> 00:06:00,005
What? But you don't
know how to bowl. Oops.

105
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,408
I'm keeping it,
and I'm going to use it.

106
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:05,144
Thank you
for the present, Homer.

107
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,613
Well... you're...
welcome.

108
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:18,023
Excuse me.
Where do I throw this?

109
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:20,126
- Over there.
- Thank you.

110
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,628
- You're gonna need a lane.
- No, thanks.

111
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:25,131
- I'm here out of spite.
- Can't bowl without a lane.

112
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:29,402
- Well, all right.
- Here you go. You keep score on this.

113
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,637
- What size shoes do you wear?
- Never you mind.

114
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,639
You can't wear
street shoes on the lanes.

115
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,841
You gotta wear bowling shoes.
What size, please?

116
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,511
- 13 double "A."
- 13 double "A "?

117
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:41,814
This is the closest I've got.

118
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,816
A nine and a fifteen.

119
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,651
Thank you.
Hmm.

120
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:50,123
A little warm and moist.

121
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,125
Ugh!

122
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,128
Hmm.

123
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,835
Hmm.

124
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,544
So, 120 pins later,
I am the better man.

125
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:19,352
I don't see what he's doing
that's so different from what I'm doing.

126
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:21,354
Hmm.

127
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:26,459
Oh!

128
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,461
I'm--
I'm awfully sorry.

129
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,463
Entirely my fault.

130
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,532
It is nice
to meet you,

131
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,034
Homer.

132
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:38,972
Oh, no, no.
Homer's my... ball's name.

133
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,142
I'm Marge.

134
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:48,448
Your fingers are so slender,
so feminine.

135
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,650
They're far too tapered
for the ball you're using.

136
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,087
You need something lighter.
More delicate.

137
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,089
Here.
Use my ball.

138
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:59,159
No. No, thank you,
Mr., um, Brunswick.

139
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,661
- Call me Jacques.
-Jacques.

140
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,332
- Marge.
- I'll just use my ball.

141
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,033
As you wish.

142
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,670
Many people have senseless
attachments to heavy, clumsy things,

143
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,672
such as this Homer
of yours.

144
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,842
- Hmm.
- May I ask you a bold question?

145
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,844
- Sure.
- You've never bowled before.

146
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,846
- Never. No.
- No.

147
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:21,848
Then I will teach you.

148
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:25,285
- I don't wanna trouble you.
- Not at all. I am a professional.

149
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:27,854
Roll the ball for me, Marge.
Let me see your form.

150
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:31,592
All right. But I'm not vey good.

151
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,464
I can hit that one pin all right,
but the rest of them don't even wobble.

152
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:39,666
I can help you, Marge.
Pick up the ball.

153
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:42,169
Pick up Homer.
Pick him up.

154
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:44,171
Oh!

155
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,175
- Now throw. Throw, damn you.
- But--

156
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,082
You're a very good teacher.

157
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,785
Yes, I am a very good teacher,
and I can teach you everything.

158
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:00,854
I can tell you what the little arrows
on the wood floor mean,

159
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:02,890
which frame
is the beer frame.

160
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,959
I bet you don't know how to make
a five-seven-ten split.

161
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,161
- Do you, Marge?
- No.

162
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:09,964
But first of all, you yell,
"The eight-pin is a cop."

163
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:12,666
Let it out, Marge. Laugh loud.

164
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,169
Laugh out loud.
You'll lose weight.

165
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,171
- Oh, that's very funny.
- Feels good.

166
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:19,774
I didn't realize there was
so much to this game.

167
00:09:19,774 --> 00:09:21,776
What do you charge
for lessons?

168
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:24,412
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Twenty-five dollars!

169
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:26,981
It's a $40 value.

170
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:28,983
Well, all right.
When do we start?

171
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,218
We have already begun.

172
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,390
Now this is living,
hey, kids?

173
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,660
Hot pizza--
the food of kings.

174
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,663
Don't be scared, Dad.
It's not so hard takin' care of us.

175
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:44,999
Lisa, I'm not scared.

176
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,702
I think it's a great chance
to spend some time with you kids.

177
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:50,404
Your mother always gets to be alone
with you, and now it's my turn.

178
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,910
Does the time
always drag like this?

179
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:59,614
First, you must get
to know your lane.

180
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:03,418
Feel the slickness.
Feel the satiny finish.

181
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:06,220
Caress it.
Experience it.

182
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,423
- Quite smooth, isn't it, Marge?
- Ooh, very smooth.

183
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,491
- Smooth? Yes?
- Yes, very. Yes.

184
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,227
- Yes. Smooth? Yes.
- Smooth. Yes.

185
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:16,030
You could eat off of it.
You hungry?

186
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,533
- Yes.
- Four onion rings!

187
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,035
Mmm. Delicioso!

188
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:24,706
- My compliments to the delivery boy.
- We've eaten and eaten well.

189
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:28,977
What else do we have to do?
Let's check the list your mom left us.

190
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:32,714
Eat. Mm-hmm.
Oh, clean up.

191
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:35,717
Don't worry, everybody. This will be
a breeze if we all pitch in.

192
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,624
All right!
We're clean!

193
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:47,295
Now we'll...
put Maggie to bed.

194
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,432
Lullaby
and good night

195
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:53,234
Go to bed
and sleep tight

196
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:56,738
Close your eyes
Start to yawn

197
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:59,808
Pleasant dreams
until the dawn

198
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:10,519
- Homer. Homer?
- Huh?

199
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,221
Oh, how was bowling?

200
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:15,357
It's a very
challenging hobby.

201
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,427
Sport, dear.
It's a sport, you silly thing.

202
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:23,799
Mm-hmm. But l think I'll do
much better tomorrow night.

203
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,801
You're going back?

204
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:28,937
Sure. If you don't mind
taking care of the kids again.

205
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,607
Uh, no.
I don't mind.

206
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,609
Good night, Homer.

207
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,611
Good night.

208
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:40,415
- It is for you.
- Oh, Jacques, it fits.

209
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:43,619
You got it in my size,
and it has my name on it.

210
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:45,621
It's really for me.

211
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:49,358
Seventeen-fifty.
Enjoy it, my darling.

212
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,056
Here we are.

213
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:24,160
- You didn't have to drop me off.
- But I wanted to.

214
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,230
Marge, do you know how beautiful
you look in the moonlight?

215
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,067
Oh, Jacques.
I'm a married woman.

216
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,069
I know. I know.

217
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,037
My mind says,"Stop,"
but my heart...

218
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,540
and my hips
cry," Proceed."

219
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,177
Marge, darling,
I want to see you tomorrow.

220
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:45,848
Not at Barney's Bowlarama. Away from
the thunderous folly of clattering pins.

221
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:48,351
- Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
- What's brunch?

222
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:51,654
You'll love it. It's not quite
breakfast, it's not quite lunch,

223
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,357
but it comes with a slice of
cantaloupee at the end.

224
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,161
You don't get completely what you would
at breakfast, but you get a good meal.

225
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:01,264
- I don't think so.
- Marge, darling,

226
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,066
there are ten pins
in my heart.

227
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,068
You've knocked over eight.

228
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:08,671
Won't you please
pick up that spare?

229
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:12,875
Mm. Mm.
All right!

230
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,751
- Marge?
- What, Homer?

231
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:25,054
Nothing.

232
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,998
-Uh-oh. Schoolbus.

233
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,168
Here you go, kids.
Special lunches.

234
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,303
Lots of good things
for growing bodies...

235
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,305
and some treats
just for fun.

236
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:45,675
- Ay, caramba!
- Are you going bowling
again tonight, Mom?

237
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,877
Well, yes, I am,
as a matter of fact.

238
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:51,981
Here's more treats.
Your dad will take care of dinner.

239
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,384
Mmm, Wednesday.
Hoagie night.

240
00:13:56,486 --> 00:14:01,057
Good-bye, Lisa.
My darling little Lisa.

241
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:05,795
Good-bye, Bart.
My special little guy.

242
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,000
Mmm!
Great lunches, eh, Lis?

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,005
Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what
psychologists call overcompensation.

244
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:18,175
Mom is wracked with guilt
because her marriage is failing.

245
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,177
Hey, don't
rock the boat, man.

246
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,312
Whatever it is,
we're making out like bandits.

247
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,481
Bart, I read about
what happens to kids...

248
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,883
whose parents no longer love
and cherish each other.

249
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,486
They go through
eight separate stages.

250
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,489
Right now,
I'm in stage three, fear.

251
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,625
You're in stage two,
denial.

252
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,627
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

253
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,629
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

254
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,498
- I'm not. I'm not. Am not!
- I stand corrected.

255
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:48,605
- Mimosa?
- I'm a married women.
Don't call me that.

256
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,607
No, no, no, no, no.

257
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:52,609
Mimosa is the name
of the drink.

258
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,611
It's orange juice
and champagne.

259
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:58,682
You're so wonderful that you thought
it was something offensive.

260
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:01,018
Oh, well, thank you.

261
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,620
Marge? Marge Simpson.

262
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:06,390
You remember me, don't you?
I'm Helen Lovejoy,

263
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,426
- the gossipy wife of the minister.
- Hello, Helen.

264
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,695
I had just finished eating
and was about to leave...

265
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:13,998
when I looked over this way
and said to myself,

266
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:18,636
"Isn't that Marge Simpson having brunch
with a man who isn't her husband?"

267
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:21,505
And I just had to come over
and say hello.

268
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,941
- We're, um--
- Oh, don't squirm on my account.

269
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,610
I am giving her
a bowling lesson, thank you.

270
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,615
Now, Marge, the pins on the
three-seven-ten split would be here.

271
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:34,118
We'll make this little piece
of food the ball.

272
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:37,755
The ball's bigger.
But for food, this is a good ball.

273
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:40,124
Oh, well, bye-bye.

274
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:43,127
- See you in church on Sunday, Marge.
- Good-bye, Helen.

275
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:45,329
Good-bye, Helen.

276
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,331
You have
a lovely friend there.

277
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:49,433
Let's hope something runs over her.

278
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,437
Your laughter
is like music to me.

279
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,140
But if you laugh
at what I say next, I will die,

280
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,142
for I am about to say
something very serious,

281
00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:00,144
perhaps shocking.

282
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:03,748
Marge, my darling, I want you
to meet with me again,

283
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:06,751
- That doesn't shock me.
- Away from prying eyes,

284
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:09,754
away from the Helens
of the world,

285
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:13,024
at my apartment--
the Fiesta Terrace.

286
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:27,739
I've been waiting for you.
Come in, my captivating one.

287
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,842
May I have this dance?

288
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,844
Sure.

289
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,522
Whoa!

290
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:51,629
You certainly have a lot
of bowling trophies.

291
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:54,065
I like you so much.

292
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:56,134
They're not for bowling,
Marge.

293
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:59,070
You're so naive.
They are for lovemaking.

294
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:01,439
- Really?
- Yes.

295
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:05,944
Oh!

296
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:09,948
- Champagne?
- Please.

297
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:11,950
There, my darling.

298
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:15,453
Thank you.

299
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:18,557
What cosmic force
brought us together, Marge?

300
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:21,059
- Destiny?
- Yes.

301
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,161
Some divine pinspotter...

302
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,565
must have placed us
side by side.

303
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:29,634
Like two fragile
bowling pins--

304
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,636
Standing bravely--

305
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:34,473
- Until inevitably--
- We must topple.

306
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:41,647
Marge, speak to me.

307
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,251
- Is Thursday okay?
- It's okay, indeed.

308
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:00,165
" For Marge"?

309
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:13,145
Hey, Dad. What do you say
we toss the ol' apple around?

310
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:17,483
Son, I don't know if l can lift
my head, let alone a ball.

311
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,785
Aw, come on, Dad.
Get the lead out.

312
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:23,289
Simpson checks the runner on first.
He's cool. He's fine.

313
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:26,392
Here's the windup,
and here's the pitch.

314
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,263
Dad, you didn't
even say "ouch."

315
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:34,467
Oh, sorry.
Ouch.

316
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,569
Lisa. Lisa, I think
you're right about Dad.

317
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:38,704
- Something's very, very wrong here.
- Frightened, Bart?

318
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:40,906
Welcome to stage three,
fear.

319
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:42,775
We gotta do something, man.

320
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,777
Sorry, Bart.
I'd love to help you,

321
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:47,880
but I'm mired
in stage five, self-pity.

322
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,882
Look, Dad. I don't know
what's going on,

323
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:51,884
but once you gave me
some advice that might help.

324
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,186
I gave you advice?
Get out of here.

325
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:57,390
Yeah, you did. You told me
when something's bothering you...

326
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,792
and you're too damn stupid
to know what to do,

327
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:02,094
just keep
your fool mouth shut.

328
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:03,963
At least that way,
you won't make things worse.

329
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:06,599
Hmm. Good advice.

330
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,712
Marge,
may I speak to you?

331
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,582
- Sure.
- You know, I've been thinking.

332
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:24,717
Everyone makes peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches,

333
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,886
but usually the jelly
drips out over the side...

334
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,088
and the guy's
hands get all sticky.

335
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:32,725
But your jelly stays right in the middle
where it's supposed to.

336
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,894
I don't know how you do it.

337
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:38,097
You just got a gift, I guess.
I've always thought so.

338
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:42,101
I just never mentioned it,
but it's time you knew how I feel.

339
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:44,904
I don't believe
in keeping feelings bottled up.

340
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:50,009
Good-bye, my wife.

341
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:52,779
- Good-bye, Homer.

342
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,589
To the most beautiful
moment in life.

343
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:04,924
Better than the deed,
better than the memory--

344
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,427
the moment
of anticipation.

345
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,099
Oh, Jacques, you handsome devil.
Look at you.

346
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:17,204
You're really going
to strike out tonight!

347
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,609
- Ain't you hungry, Homer?
- Starving.

348
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:24,611
Well, then why aren't
you eating your sandwich?

349
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:28,415
How can I eat it? She made it.
It's all I have left.

350
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,718
Domestic situation.

351
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:33,414
Uh, huh?

352
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:36,350
Marge!
What a lovely surprise.

353
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,419
You're here to see me,
right?

354
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:40,855
Of course!

355
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:52,867
Hey, way to go, Homer.
Way to go!

356
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,669
What will I tell
the boss?

357
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:59,674
Tell him I'm going to the backseat
of my car with the woman I love,

358
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,344
and I won't be back
for ten minutes.

359
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,969
Shh!

9999
