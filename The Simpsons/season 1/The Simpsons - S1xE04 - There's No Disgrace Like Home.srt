2
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:18,194
Aah!

3
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,198
Ooh!

4
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:34,144
- Yeah. Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah!

5
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,780
- Yeah? Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

6
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,582
Hey, what's the problem here?

7
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,184
We were fighting over
which one of us loves you more.

8
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:44,888
You were?
Aw, well, go ahead.

9
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:46,890
- you love him more.
- No, you do.

10
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:49,192
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do!

11
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,062
You better get this out
of your system right now!

12
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,966
I don't want you embarrassing
me at my boss's picnic.

13
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,069
Mmm. Marshmallow.

14
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,774
Homer!

15
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,678
I'm tying to get the unfortunate noises
out of my system while I can.

16
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:10,280
I don't want to embarrass myself
at the company picnic.

17
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:15,385
Are you sure that's enough? The boss
loves your delicious gelatin desserts.

18
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:20,190
Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns
just said he liked it... once.

19
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,894
That's the only time he's ever spoken
to me without using the word "bonehead."

20
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,900
There it is, kids!

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,405
Stately Burns Manor.
Heaven on Earth.

22
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,775
Okay, now look, my boss
is gonna be at this picnic.

23
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,278
I want you to show your father
some love and/or respect.

24
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:43,581
- Tough choice.
- I'm picking respect.

25
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:46,217
Good to see you.
Glad you could make it.

26
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:49,086
Oh, Thank you, Mr. Burns.
I'm so glad you invited us.

27
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,189
- Not me. I had to miss
little league for this.
- Quiet, Tom.

28
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:56,494
Oh, please, don't fight.
Just go out back and have a good time.

29
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:58,496
Fire that man, Smithers.

30
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:00,998
I don't want him or his
unpleasant family to ruin my picnic.

31
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,000
He'll be gone
by the tug-of-war, sir.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,803
- Excellent.
-Uh, afternoon, Mr. Burns.

33
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:08,406
Uh, hello, there, uh--
uh--

34
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:11,208
- Simpson, Homer.
- Here you go, sir.

35
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:16,414
Ah! Oh, yes. Uh, oh, and this
must be your lovely wife, Marge.

36
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:19,016
Oh, and look at little,
uh, Lisa.

37
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,018
Why, she's growing
like a weed.

38
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:24,222
-And this must be, uh, Brat.
- Bart.

39
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:29,393
Don't correct the man, Brat. Oh, boss,
look what we brought-- gelatin desserts.

40
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:32,330
Oh, for the love of Peter.
That's all anybody brought.

41
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,633
Some damn fool went around
telling everyone I love that slimy goop.

42
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,503
Well, toss it in the pile
over there.

43
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,638
And... make yourselves at home.

44
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:43,841
Hear that, Dad? You can lie around
in your underwear and scratch yourself.

45
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,344
- Now, you listen to me--
- Trouble, Simpson?

46
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:51,649
No. just congratulating the
son on a fine joke about his old man.

47
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,723
Now remember,
as far as anyone knows,

48
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,725
we're a nice,
normal family.

49
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:03,895
Hey, Bart, last one in
the fountain's a rotten egg!

50
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:06,898
D-oh! Be normal.
Be normal!

51
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:10,435
Mmm!
What an adorable little girl.

52
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,704
Thank you.

53
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:15,640
Why don't we dump them in the nursery
and get a glass of punch?

54
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,342
Oh, I'm not much
of a drinker.

55
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:20,211
Hey, isn't that your boy there
torturing the swans?

56
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:23,148
Bart!

57
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:25,517
Maybe I will take you up
on that punch.

58
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:31,256
Gee, do you think we should
leave the kids unsupervised?

59
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:35,160
You're right.
There.

60
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:40,765
Bart! Lisa!

61
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:43,535
- Where are you kids? D-oh!
- Whoops.

62
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:46,438
- Got ya!
- Careful. Blow a gasket, lose your job.

63
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:48,940
The father/son-sack race...

64
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,943
will begin in five minutes
on the north lawn.

65
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:56,448
Participation is mandatory.
Repeat, mandatory. That is all.

66
00:04:56,581 --> 00:05:00,852
- you remember the rules?
- Shut my mouth, and let your boss win.

67
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:02,754
Hey!

68
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:07,659
I don't know who to love more:
my son, Joshua, who's captain
of the football team, :

69
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:10,529
Or my daughter, Amber,
who got the lead in the school play.

70
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:13,332
Usually, I use their grades
as a tiebreaker,

71
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:15,334
but they both got
straight A's this term.

72
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:17,469
- What's a mother to do?
- Mm-hmm.

73
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:20,772
- Well, I sense greatness in my family.
- Your family?

74
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:25,144
Well, it's a greatness
that others can't see, but it's there.

75
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:29,581
And if it's not true greatness we have,
we're at least average.

76
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,785
I don't want to alarm anyone,

77
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:37,089
but I think there's
a little "al-key-hol" in this punch.

78
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:42,661
- Mr. Burns, are you ready?
- Yes.

79
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,964
- Are you set?
- Yes.

80
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:47,399
Go, Mr. Burns.

81
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:58,277
Man, this is pathetic.
I'm goin' for it!

82
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:00,980
Bart, no!
No! No! No!

83
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,383
Oh, no, wait.
Oh, no. Bart, don't.

84
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:06,152
Don't. No!

85
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:15,795
Close one this year.

86
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:19,765
- Here we sit enjoying the shade
- Hey, brother, pour on the wine

87
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:23,703
- Drink the drink that I have made
- Hey, brother, pour on the wine

88
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:26,205
He's here at last my one and only
Good-bye friends

89
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:28,774
-And don't be lonely
-Hey, brother, pour on the wine

90
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:32,778
- Marge, I need you!
- Hey, Homie, did you try the punch?

91
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:34,914
Snap out of it, Marge.

92
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:37,216
You've gotta come with me.
The boss is going to make a toast.

93
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:39,519
Well, I'm not much of a drinker.

94
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:42,588
Why, you picked a perfect time to start.

95
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:50,530
Musicians, cease that infernal tootling.

96
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:54,901
"Thank you all..."
uh,"for coming."

97
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:01,908
- Marge, knock it off.
- Well, I'm sorry.

98
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:03,776
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Marge!

99
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,512
" But now it's time
to say good-bye.

100
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:09,282
Please get off my property
until next year."

101
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:13,086
I suggest you don't dawdle. The hounds
will be released in ten minutes.

102
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,327
- Did you have a good time, son?
- Yeah, thanks, Pop.

103
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:26,099
Aw, that's the kind of family unity
I like to see. Smithers.

104
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,101
- Yes, sir?
- Get that man's name.

105
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:30,537
I predict big things for him
down at the power plant.

106
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:32,539
Quick, Bart,
give me a kiss.

107
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:35,108
Kiss you?
But, Dad, I'm your kid.

108
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,711
Bart, please?
Five bucks for a kiss.

109
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:44,517
I have never seen such
an obvious attempt to curry my favor.

110
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:47,220
Fabulous observation, sir.
Just fabulous.

111
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,423
Boy, I'm glad that's over.

112
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:53,727
- Now we can go home and act normal.
- What do you mean?

113
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:57,731
Aw, come on.
That cornball routine?

114
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:00,534
"I love you, Daddy."
Give me a break.

115
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,336
- I pity you.
- Why?

116
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:06,339
- After you.
- Thank you so much.

117
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:10,844
- Me first! No, me. Me. Me.
- No, me. No, me. Me. Me.

118
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:14,548
Honey, you look so tired.
Would you like me to drive?

119
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:17,851
Oh, Homie, I think
I'm going to be sick.

120
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,021
There was a farmer
who had a dog

121
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,223
And Bingo was his name
Oh

122
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:27,027
B-i-n-g-o
B-i-n-g-o

123
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:30,731
B-i-n-g-o and Bingo
was his name, oh

124
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:32,833
Homie, get in the car.

125
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:35,636
- This is where you belong.
- Yeah, Homer.

126
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:37,538
Room for one more.

127
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:42,543
One of us. One of us.
One of us. One of us.

128
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:49,450
B-i-n-g-o
B-i-n-g-o

129
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,052
-B-i-n-g-o

130
00:08:56,657 --> 00:09:00,361
The father of the family
has worked all day...

131
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:02,463
to find this food
for his children.

132
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,534
Unable to fend for themselves,
the baby bald eaglets...

133
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:10,538
are dependent on their mother
regurgitating food which she has found.

134
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,040
- Hey!
- Look, everybody.

135
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:15,042
Yesterday was
a real eye-opener.

136
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:17,478
We've got to do better
as a family.

137
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:22,283
Tonight, we're not going to shovel food
in our mouths while we stare at the TV.

138
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,354
We're going to eat at the
dining room table like a normal family.

139
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:29,290
- Happy, Dad?
- Yes.

140
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,158
Good.
Commence shoveling.

141
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:34,662
No. We're going
to say grace first.

142
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:36,664
Okay. Rub-a-dub-dub,
thanks for the grub.

143
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,769
No!
Ignore the boy, Lord.

144
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:45,173
Can the chatter, and bow your heads.

145
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:49,277
Dear Lord, Thank you
for this microwave bounty,

146
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:51,279
even though
we don't deserve it.

147
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:54,082
I mean, our kids are
uncontrollable hellions.

148
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,784
Pardon my French,
but they act like savages.

149
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:58,986
Did you see them
at the picnic?

150
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:02,290
Of course you did. You're everywhere.
You're "omnivorous."

151
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:04,993
Oh Lord, why did you
smite me with this family?

152
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:08,162
- Amen!
- Let's eat.

153
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:09,597
No, I'm not done yet!

154
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,666
But, Homer, how long are we
supposed to sit here...

155
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,669
and listen to you bad-mouth us
to the Man Upstairs?

156
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:18,406
I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes
I think we're the worst family in town.

157
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:20,408
Maybe we should move
to a larger community.

158
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:22,977
- D-oh!
- Don't have a cow, Dad.

159
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:25,580
The sad truth is,
all families are like us.

160
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,918
You think so, huh? Well, there's
only one way to find out. Follow me.

161
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:38,493
Look at that, kids.
No fighting. No yelling.

162
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:40,295
- No belching.
- The dad has his shirt on.

163
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:42,163
Look, napkins!

164
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:45,667
- These people are obviously freaks.
- Oh, you think so?

165
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,670
Well, let's see
what's behind door number two.

166
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,806
- What are they doing?
- They're having a conversation.

167
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:54,609
They actually enjoy
talking to each other.

168
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:56,111
I wish I could hear
what they're saying.

169
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:59,214
Papa, I believe I heard
some rustling in the bushes.

170
00:10:59,214 --> 00:11:02,417
Hmm. I did too.
Better get the gun.

171
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,486
Where's he going?

172
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:07,923
Probably to get the old man
his pipe and slippers.

173
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:22,604
Whoa, look at this place.
What a dump!

174
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:25,207
It's worse than you think.

175
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:27,910
I just trampled
this poor sap's flower bed.

176
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:30,612
- Homer, this is our house.
- Aaah!

177
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:32,915
- Are you coming in, Homer?
- No, no.

178
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:35,417
I wanna be alone with my thought.

179
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:40,422
Fans are getting a bit anxious here.
Another beer, Moe.

180
00:11:40,422 --> 00:11:43,625
What's-a matter, Homer?
Bloodiest fight of the year.

181
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:45,928
You're sitting there like
a thirsty bump on a log.

182
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:48,297
- Eddie.
- Evening, Moe.

183
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,933
- Want some pretzels?
- No, thanks. We're on duty.

184
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,936
- A couple beers would be nice, though.
- Two bucks, boys.

185
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,738
Just kidding.

186
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:59,041
Good one, Moe. We're looking for
a family of Peeping Toms...

187
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,310
who's been terrorizing
the neighborhood.

188
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,046
Quiet, boy.
Let the nice people enjoy their beers.

189
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:08,551
Ah, don't worry.
This dog has the scent.

190
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:12,621
- What's gotten into Bobo?
- I got some wieners in my pocket.

191
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:16,025
That figures.
Come on, you stupid dog.

192
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:22,431
You know, Moe, my mom once said
something that really stuck with me.

193
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:26,836
She said," Homer,
you're a big disappointment."

194
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:31,607
And God bless her soul,
she was really on to something.

195
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:34,610
Don't blame yourself, Homer.
You got dealt a bad hand.

196
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:36,846
You got crummy little kids
that nobody can control.

197
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:40,116
You can't talk that way about my kids!
Or at least two of them.

198
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,852
- Why, you got two I haven't met?
- Why, you--

199
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,656
- Here's five you haven't met.
- A tremendous right. That's gotta hurt.

200
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:50,660
This fight is over!

201
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,529
All-Star Boxing
is brought to you by...

202
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:56,432
Dr. Marvin Monroe's
Family Therapy Center.

203
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:58,668
Huh? What?

204
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:02,171
- Honey, aren't you going to work today?
- Oh, I don't think so.

205
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:05,675
Honey, you have a problem, and
it won't get better till you admit it.

206
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,244
I admit this:
You better shut your big yap.

207
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:11,981
- Oh, you shut up. No, you shut up!
- No, you shut up!

208
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:15,551
- Shut up!
- Why don't you both shut up?

209
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:18,755
Hi, friends.
I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe.

210
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,858
Does this scene look familiar?
If so, I can help.

211
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:24,928
No gimmicks. No pills.
No faddiets.

212
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:29,966
Just family bliss, or double
your money back. So call today.

213
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,870
Dr. Marvin Monroe's
Family Therapy Center.

214
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,972
Why don't you call right now?

215
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,174
When will I learn?

216
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,378
The answer to life's problems
aren't at the bottom of a bottle.

217
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:44,047
They're on TV!

218
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,796
All right,
time for a family meeting.

219
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:02,165
Why can't we have a meeting
when you're watching TV?

220
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:07,304
Now look, you know and I know this
family needs help, professional help.

221
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,873
So I've made us an appointment
with Dr. Marvin Monroe.

222
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,374
The fat guy on TV?

223
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:15,178
You're sending us to a doctor
who advertises on pro wrestling?

224
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:17,681
Boxing, Lisa, boxing.
There's a world of difference.

225
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,183
Gee, Homer, are you sure
this is the right thing to do?

226
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:22,786
Honey, I've given
this matter a lot of study,

227
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,689
and of all the commercials I saw,
his was the best.

228
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:30,060
- All it costs is $250.
- We don't have that kind of money.

229
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:32,696
Well, then, we're just
going to have to dig deep.

230
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:35,599
- Marge, go get the kids' college fund.
- Hey!

231
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,502
- Oh, Homer.
- Oh, come on, Marge.

232
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:42,172
Why scrimp now on the off chance that
they'll actually get in some place?

233
00:14:42,306 --> 00:14:45,309
Forty-eight.
Forty-nine. Fifty.

234
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,311
Eighty-eight dollars
and fifty cents.

235
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:51,682
That's it? That's the college fund
we've been saving for all these years?

236
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:54,184
I guess I'd have needed
a partial scholarship.

237
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:55,786
We're not licked yet.

238
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:59,189
To save this family, we're going to
have to make the supreme sacrifice.

239
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,693
No, Dad.
Please don't pawn the TV.

240
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:05,429
Oh, come on, Dad,
anything but that.

241
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:08,365
Homer, couldn't we pawn
my engagement ring instead?

242
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:13,103
Now, I appreciate that, honey,
but we need $150 here!

243
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,507
Afternoon, Simpson.
What can I do for ya?

244
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:20,811
Would you pay $150
for this lovely Motorola?

245
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:23,614
- Is it cable ready?
- Ready as she'll ever be.

246
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:26,984
Mister, you got yourself a deal.

247
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:35,626
All our money,
the college funds, the TV.

248
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:39,130
Homer, you're driving a stake through
the hearts of those who love you.

249
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,600
- Hey, no pain, no gain.
- Will you be paying by cash or check?

250
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:47,104
Cash, of course.
I've got $250 right here with me.

251
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:51,309
I'm holding it right now.
Here it is. Look.

252
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,312
Check it out.
250 big ones.

253
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,113
If you really want
to impress her,

254
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,116
show her the big, empty space
where our TV used to be.

255
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,617
- Bart!
- Come on, family.

256
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:03,421
Let's go celebrate our newfound
ability to express love.

257
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:06,124
I'm taking you out for
frosty chocolate milkshakes.

258
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:07,492
Yea!

259
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,331
There go my young-girl dreams of Vassar.

260
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,302
Hello, I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe.
No doubt you recognize me from TV.

261
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,304
- We would if we had one.
- Lisa!

262
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:21,739
No, no, Homer,
don't stifle the youngster.

263
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:24,609
Your family must feel free
to express itself.

264
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:27,045
That's what these pads
and jumbo markers are for.

265
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,615
I want you to draw for me
your fears, your anxieties,

266
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:33,418
the roots of your
unhappiness.

267
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:35,553
Take a deep,
cleansing breath.

268
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:39,758
And begin.

269
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:46,064
- Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

270
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:48,633
No surprises here.

271
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:51,870
Homer?

272
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:55,240
Homer, what have you got for us?

273
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,745
- Homer?
- Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

274
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,847
If you had been
paying attention,

275
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:05,050
perhaps you would have noticed
that your family sees you...

276
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:10,055
as a rather stern authority figure,
an ogre, if you will.

277
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:13,358
- Now, Doctor, that's not true.
- Ogre is such a strong word.

278
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:16,361
Right on, Doc!
Another successful diagnosis.

279
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:18,130
- That does it!
- Whoa!

280
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:23,068
Okay, you wanna kill each
other. That's good. That's healthy.

281
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:26,571
There's nothing necessarily wrong
with hostile conflict.

282
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:30,375
All I ask is that you use
my patented aggression therapy mallets.

283
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:33,879
- Good idea.
- All right.
- I don't know.

284
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:37,182
Okay. Let's take another
deep, cleansing breath.

285
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:53,766
These mallet things are padded
with foam rubber. What's the point?

286
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,868
They'd work much better
without the padding, Doc.

287
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,070
No, no. That's not true.

288
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,938
- Ah! Give me that.
- See?

289
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:03,876
Yes, well, that concludes
this portion of our treatment.

290
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:06,879
- Are we cured yet?
- Don't be ridiculous.

291
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:11,884
You will be, but it's going to require
somewhat more unorthodox methods.

292
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:14,053
- Unortho-what?
- Don't worry.

293
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:17,256
I'll have plenty of time to explain
while I warm up the...

294
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:19,258
electric generator.

295
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,194
Everyone comfy?
Good.

296
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,363
Now, don't touch any of
those buttons in front of you...

297
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:29,702
for a very important reason, i.e., you
are wired into the rest of your family.

298
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:34,073
You have the ability to shock them,
and they have the ability to shock--

299
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,808
-just testing.

300
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,010
- Why, you--
- No, Homer, not yet.

301
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:41,180
This is what is known
as aversion therapy.

302
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:44,684
When someone hurts you emotionally,
you will hurt them physically.

303
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:48,688
And gradually you will learn
not to hurt each other at all.

304
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,190
And won't that be
wonderful, Homer?

305
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:53,626
Oh, yes, Doctor.

306
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:56,195
- Whoa!
- Aaah!

307
00:18:56,195 --> 00:19:00,199
-How could you shock your little sister?
-My finger slipped.

308
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,503
- So did mine.
- Aaaah!

309
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:05,505
Bart, Lisa, stop that.

310
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:11,511
No, no. Now, wait a minute.

311
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:15,114
Wait! Wait!
Folks, if I could--

312
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:17,817
This is not the way
to get healthy!

313
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:25,625
No! You don't understand, Simpsons!

314
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:28,628
People, please!

315
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:32,632
Boy.

316
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:34,934
Someone's really
gobbling up the juice, sir.

317
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:36,903
Excellent.
Excellent.

318
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:41,107
Perhaps this energy conservation fad
is as dead as the dodo.

319
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:44,811
No! No! Simpsons!

320
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:47,213
- Son of a--
-Stop!

321
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:50,817
- Dr. Monroe, your other patients
have fled the building.
- Stop!

322
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,819
You're damaging
the equipment.

323
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:03,630
-Nice hair, Mom.
-I thought we were making real progress.

324
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,701
No, I'm sorry, you're not!
You've just got to go.

325
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:11,204
Wait a minute, Doc,
your TV commercial said,

326
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:14,141
family bliss
or double our money back.

327
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,943
Oh, but that was just--

328
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,514
All right.
Get the money.

329
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:24,518
20,40,60,80,1.20,40,60,80,2.
20,40,60,80,3.

330
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:27,921
20,40,60,80,4.
20,40,60,80,500.

331
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:30,624
Just go, and never tell
anyone you were here!

332
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,760
Wow, 500 smackers.

333
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:37,831
Homer, how wonderful.
Our first pleasant surprise.

334
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:41,068
It's not the money, as much as
the feeling that we earned it.

335
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:42,736
You did it, Dad.

336
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:47,641
Shouldn't we be heading down
to the pawn shop to get our TV back?

337
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:50,344
That piece of junk?
Forget it.

338
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:52,446
We're gonna get a new TV.

339
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:55,449
Twenty-one inch screen,
realistic flesh tones...

340
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:59,453
and a little cart so we can wheel it
into the dining room on holidays.

341
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:03,757
- Yea!
- Oh, Homer, we love you.
