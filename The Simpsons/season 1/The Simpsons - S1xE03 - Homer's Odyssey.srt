1
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,745
- Aah!

2
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,766
Now class, I don't want this field trip
to be a repeat of our infamous visit...

3
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,060
to the Springfield State Prison.

4
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,855
So, I want you all
to be on your best behavior,

5
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,857
especially you, Bart Simpson.

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,735
Mrs. Krabappel,
I didn't unlock that door.

7
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,866
- Uh, sorry, little dudes.

8
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,535
Party hardy was tardy.

9
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,830
- All right, children. Count off.
- One, two, three.

10
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,042
- Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman.
- Hey, Bart dude.

11
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,044
Any new tattoos, Otto?

12
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,046
Oh, funny
you should ask, man.

13
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,757
This morning I woke up
with this one.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,259
Cool. I want one.

15
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,763
Huh. Not till you're 14,
my little friend.

16
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,434
Bart! Bart Simpson!

17
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,562
Take your seat, Bart.

18
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,065
Oh, please, Mrs. Krabappel,
not next to Wendell.

19
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,443
He pukes on every bus ride.
No offense, Wendell.

20
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,863
- Oh.
- Be that as it may,
it's the only seat left,

21
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,949
so get in there!

22
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,664
Please try not
to shake the seat like that.

23
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:47,167
Now, class, remember. Do not stick
any part of your body out the window.

24
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,671
We all know the tragic story
of the young man who stuck
his arm out the window...

25
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,549
and had it ripped off by a big truck
coming in the other direction.

26
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,844
And I was that boy.

27
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,471
Uh, Bart Simpson, sit down!

28
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,557
I've had just about enough
of your tomfoolery.

29
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,144
Oh, I don't feel so hot.

30
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,334
Look, there's
our school again.

31
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,964
- Otto, are you sure you--
- It's a shortcut, Mrs. K. Trust me.

32
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,551
Mrs. Krabappel!
Mrs. Krabappel!

33
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,346
Bart, not another word out of you, or
I'll subject you to the humiliation...

34
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,348
of making you sing
in front of the class.

35
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,642
- Can I pick the song?
- No.

36
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,770
The song will be
"john Henry Was a Steel Drivin' Man."

37
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,939
Oh, no.

38
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,233
We're gonna make you sing,
Bart Simpson.

39
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,944
Yeah, Bart Simpson,
we're gonna make you sing.

40
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:07,664
That's it, Bart. Oh,
why can't you be more like, uh, uh--

41
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:13,337
- Us, Mrs. Krabappel?
- Yes, Sherri and Terri.
They know how to behave.

42
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,049
Da, da, da, da, da, da. Whoa!

43
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,343
They took Bart Simpson
to the graveyard

44
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,553
And they buried him
in the sand

45
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,640
Oh, yeah, and every locomotive
that comes rollin' by

46
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,267
- Bart. Bart!
- Says there lies a steel-drivin' man

47
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,646
- Lord, Lord, oh, there lies a--
- Okay, Bart. Enough!

48
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,565
Hey, Wendell,
you made it, buddy.

49
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,533
And so, this plant harnesses
the power of the atom...

50
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,370
so that we have the energy
to run everything from
your favorite video game...

51
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,456
to yummy
cotton candy machines.

52
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,168
Let's learn more
about nuclear energy, shall we?

53
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,170
Lights.

54
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,343
When most people
think of nuclear energy,

55
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,345
they think of this.

56
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,558
But when we talk about
nuclear energy,

57
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:11,562
we really mean this.

58
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,064
But what exactly is
nuclear energy?

59
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,942
I don't know,
but I know someone who does.

60
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,362
-Smilin' Joe Fission.
- Hi, there, energy eaters.

61
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,073
I'm Smilin'joe Fission,
your atomic tour guide...

62
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,535
to the strange and exciting world
of nuclear power.

63
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,955
And these are rods
of uranium 235. Hi, Rod.

64
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,332
Hi. Hey. Good to see ya.

65
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,752
-Hey, you guys look hot.
-Of course we're hot. We're radioactive.

66
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,046
Uh-oh. Well, how 'bout
a dip in the pool?

67
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,466
Yeah! Last one in's the rotten rod!

68
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,553
The rods make the water
so hot it boils.

69
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,139
Ow! Ouch! Ow!

70
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:51,435
and the steams pins
turbines that generate energy.

71
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,437
Bart, sit down.

72
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,064
Uh-oh. Whoops.

73
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,151
Looks like there's a little
leftover nuclear waste. No problem.

74
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,947
I'll just put it where
nobody will find it for a million years.

75
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,243
So, now you know the whole true story
of nuclear energy,

76
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,245
our no longer
misunderstood friend.

77
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,956
So, keep on smilin'.

78
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,545
Now, let's have even more fun.

79
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,642
And, uh, over here is
our thermal regulator.

80
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,852
to your right,
if you look through this window,

81
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,856
you'll see where our water rejoins
the rest of nature's biosphere.

82
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:46,073
- Hey, Bart, our dad says
your dad is incompetent.
- What does incompetent mean?

83
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,869
It means he spends more time
yakking and scarfing down
doughnuts than doing his job.

84
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,539
Oh, okay. I thought
you were putting him down.

85
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,669
you know, I defy anyone
to tell the difference...

86
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,673
between these doughnuts
and ones baked today.

87
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:07,135
My boy's supposed to be here
any second on a field trip.
They been through here yet?

88
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,264
Come on, Simpson. If they wanted
the kids to see you sitting around...

89
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,934
on your butt and stuffin'
your face, they'd take them
on a tour of your house.

90
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,271
You're right.
I gotta get where the action is.

91
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,273
Comin' through!

92
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,441
Hey, there's my dad.

93
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:26,363
Hey, Dad! Yo, Homer!
Woo! Woo! I'm up here!

94
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,241
Oh, hi, boy!

95
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,836
-All right. Who's responsible for this?

96
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,338
-I might have known it was you, Simpson.
-But, sir, I--

97
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,341
I don't want to hear about it, Simpson.
You're fired!

98
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,261
- Oh, hi, girls.
- Hi, Daddy.

99
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,153
Here's a good job
at the fireworks factory.

100
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,239
- Those perfectionists? Forget it.
- How 'bout this?

101
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,242
Supervising technician
at the toxic waste dump.

102
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,038
I'm no supervising technician.
I'm a technical supervisor.

103
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:21,543
I've never done anything worthwhile in
my life. I'm a big, worthless nothing.

104
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,338
There, there, Homer.
You'll find a job.

105
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:28,050
You've caused plenty
of industrial accidents,
and you've always bounced back.

106
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,969
- Yeah, Dad, you can do it!
- Yeah, go for it, Dad.

107
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:35,057
You're right! I'm young, I'm
able-bodied and I'll take anything!

108
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,352
Watch out, Springfield.
Here I come.

109
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,235
Don't give up, Dad.

110
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,573
I'm just a technical supervisor
who cared too much.

111
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,159
- Moe's Tavern.
- Is Mr. Freely there?

112
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,870
- Who?
- Freely. First initials "I.P."

113
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,956
Hold on. I'll check.

114
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,543
Uh, is I.P.Freely here?

115
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:06,463
Hey, everybody!
I.P.Freely!

116
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,262
Wait a minute.
Listen to me, ya lousy bum.

117
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,264
- When I get a hold of you, you're dead.

118
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,558
I swear I'm gonna
slice your heart in half.

119
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,148
- You'll get that punk someday, Moe.
- Ah, I don't know.

120
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,068
He's tough to catch.
He keeps changing his name.

121
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,572
Oh, I think
I'll have another-- Oops.

122
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,740
Oh, I'm a little low on funds.

123
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,869
- Do you think you can
cover me just this once?
- No, sorry.

124
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:40,956
W-Why not? I think after all
these years I deserve an explanation.

125
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,751
I don't think you're ever gonna get
another job and be able to pay me back.

126
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,963
- Oh.
- Don't worry. We're still friends.

127
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:52,634
I fall to pieces

128
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:00,350
- All you all right, Homer?
- I'm fine. I'm just thinking.

129
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,937
Well, I've been thinking too.

130
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:09,568
you know, Homer, you've always
been such a good provider,
but when we got married,

131
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:14,072
Mr. Berger promised I could come back
to my old job anytime I wanted.

132
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:17,075
you think you can
still do that kind of work?

133
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,537
Sure. You never forget.
It's just like riding a bicycle.

134
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:25,667
- Hey, Mama, where's my fries already?

135
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,842
Dad, eat something.
It's got mustard on it.

136
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,767
All he does is lie there
like an unemployed whale.

137
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,062
I don't know
what else to do.

138
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,442
There's only one thing we can do:
take advantage of the old guy.

139
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,862
you gotta sign my report card, Dad.

140
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,453
Loaf time,
the cable network for the unemployed.

141
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:05,457
We'll be back with more tips on how
to win the lottery right after his.

142
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,544
Unemployed? Out of work? Sober?

143
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:13,257
You sat around the house all day,
but now it's Duff time.

144
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,552
Duff, the beer that makes
the days fly by.

145
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,555
Can't get enough
of that wonderful Duff

146
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:23,767
-Duff beer
-Beer. Now there's a temporary solution.

147
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,146
There must be
some beer here somewhere.

148
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,148
Ah. Maybe in here.

149
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,445
Damn! I need money!

150
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,963
Oh, no.
What have I done?

151
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:56,758
I smashed open my little boy's
piggy bank, and for what?

152
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,760
A few measly cents.

153
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,638
Not even enough
to buy one beer.

154
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:06,643
Wait a minute. Let me count
and make sure. Not even close.

155
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,565
Dear family.

156
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:16,945
I am an utter failure,
and you'll be better off without me.

157
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,075
By the time you read this,
I will be in my watery grave.

158
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,163
I can only leave you with the words
my father gave me:

159
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:31,043
"Stand tall, have courage
and never give up."

160
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,755
I only hope I can provide
a better model...

161
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,757
in death than I did
in life.

162
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,843
Warmest regards.

163
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:45,474
Love, Homer J. Simpson.

164
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,548
Nothing's easy.

165
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,641
Oh, looks like young Simpson is
going to kill himself.

166
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:32,271
Well, maybe not. Maybe he's just taking
his boulder for a walk.

167
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,648
Oh.

168
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,442
- Mom! Mom! Wake up!
- We've been robbed!

169
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,863
- What?
- Someone swiped my piggy bank!

170
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,240
Your father's gone too!

171
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,076
- Look what I found.

172
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,956
Almost there.

173
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:57,171
Hey, you idiot!
Watch where you're going!

174
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,676
Well, live and learn.

175
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,555
- There he is!
- Don't do it, Dad!

176
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,065
Boy, this intersection
is dangerous.

177
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,153
Someone ought to put
a stop sign here.

178
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,655
Oh, Homer.

179
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,576
How could you think
of killing yourself? We love you.

180
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,870
- Yeah, Dad. We love you.
- Yeah.

181
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,040
Kill myself? Killing myself is
the last thing I'd ever do.

182
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,460
Now I have a purpose,
a reason to live.

183
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,545
I don't care who
I have to face.

184
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,756
I don't care who
I have to fight.

185
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,761
I will not rest until
this street gets a stop sign!

186
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,558
Next on the agenda.
Police Chief Wiggum...

187
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,769
will give us an update
on our graffiti problem.

188
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,647
Well, it's no secret
our city is under siege...

189
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,650
by a graffiti vandal
known as " El Barto."

190
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,945
Police artists have a composite sketch
of the culprit.

191
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:07,366
If anyone has any information,
please contact us immediately.

192
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,452
Cool, man.

193
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,455
- Tough customer.
- Ooh, wouldn't want to run
into him in a dark alley.

194
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:18,460
And now, new business.
Homer Simpson, local resident,
has something. Mr. Simpson?

195
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,672
Don't be nervous.
We believe in you, Homer.

196
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:27,344
Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed councilmen,

197
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:31,974
boys and girls, retired people
with nothing better to do.

198
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,560
Danger comes in
many, many forms,

199
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:40,148
- from dinosaurs that tormented
our caveman ancestors to the--
-Simpson, get to the point.

200
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,860
I think we should put a stop sign
at " D" Street and 12th.

201
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,862
- The other--
- All in favor?

202
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,864
- Aye.
- Approved. Meeting adjourned.

203
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:52,244
- Coffee and maple logs in the lobby.
- Wow. They listened to me.

204
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,872
- All right, Dad!
- Way to go, Homer.

205
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,167
- you did it, Homer.
- If they think I'm gonna stop
at that stop sign,

206
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,252
they're sadly mistaken.

207
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:28,447
- Oh, Homer, I am so proud of you.
- Proud? Proud of what?

208
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:32,451
Well, everything.
Your dip sign, for instance.

209
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:36,038
Now people won't be caught off guard
by that little "mm-mmm" in the road.

210
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,749
Ah, what a great family,
but come on.

211
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,251
We all know
this is small potatoes.

212
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:45,672
There's a danger in this town that is
bigger than all the dips put together.

213
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:50,552
- What, Dad?
- I'm talking about that.

214
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,263
you don't mean you're going
to take on your old bosses.

215
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,266
- Wow.
- Gee, Dad's a hero.

216
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,477
- What'd ya say, son?
- Nothin'.

217
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,357
That's okay. I'll just assume you said
what I thought I heard you say.

218
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,738
- He also brought you the speed bump,

219
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,658
the dip sign,

220
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:17,579
- the 15 miles per hour
speed limit on Main Street.

221
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:21,959
I give you the man whose very name
is synonymous with safety.

222
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,879
- Homer Simpson!
- Homer! Homer!

223
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,840
Thank you.

224
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:31,760
Unlike most of you,
I am not a nut.

225
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:35,848
Just a good, honest American
who opposes wrongdoing...

226
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:40,143
and especially carelessness
wherever they occur.

227
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,063
Look at that man.

228
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,567
He has the crowd
in the palm of his hand.

229
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,946
Ah, haven't seen anything
like it since Jolson. Who is he?

230
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,948
That's Homer Simpson, sir.

231
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,161
He used to work here in the plant,
but we fired him for gross incompetence.

232
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:00,247
Oh, so that's
his little game.

233
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,959
- Get this Simpson character
up here right now.
- But Mr. Burns--

234
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,046
I said do it! Now do it!
Do it! Do it!

235
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:13,677
Our lives are at the hands
of men no smarter than you or I,

236
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,555
many of them,
incompetent boobs.

237
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,850
I know this because
I worked alongside them,

238
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,852
gone bowling with them,

239
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:25,939
watched them pass me over
for promotions time and again.

240
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:30,152
- And I say, this stinks!

241
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,448
Hey. Hey, Simpson, Burns wants
to talk to you privately.

242
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,450
- Privately?
- Yes.

243
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,453
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

244
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:50,255
- Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet.
- Same here.

245
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:55,344
Simpson, I want you to rejoin
our power plant family.

246
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,972
- Sorry. No can do.
- Hear me out, Simpson!

247
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:04,561
I don't want you to come back
as a technical supervisor
or supervising technician...

248
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,563
or whatever the hell
you used to do.

249
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,859
I want you to be in charge
of safety here at the plant.

250
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,946
Safety? But, sir,
if truth be known,

251
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,449
I actually caused more accidents
around here than any other employee.

252
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,244
There were even a few doozies
no one ever found out about.

253
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,247
The generous offer I'm making
is good for exactly...

254
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,958
30 seconds, Simpson.

255
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,252
Me, in charge of safety?

256
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:33,465
This place could blow sky high.
Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now.

257
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,467
Gee, this guy's desk
sure is big.

258
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,178
I can't let Marge support
the family.

259
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,139
This guy's got the cleanest
shirt I've ever seen. What should I--

260
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,058
Simpson, time's up.

261
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,562
- Mmm, what the hey. I'll take the job.
- Excellent.

262
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:51,066
Your first duty will be
to step out on the balcony...

263
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,653
and tell that crowd
this plant is safe.

264
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,656
- What?
- Go on, Homer.

265
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,660
Homer! Homer!
Homer! Homer! Homer!

266
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,954
- Yeah, Homer!

267
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,956
Go, Dad!

268
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:10,252
Ladies and gentlemen,
this plant is--

269
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:21,763
Oh, sit tight.
I'll be right back.

270
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,560
I can't do it, Mr. Burns.

271
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,771
you mean, you're willing
to give up a good job and a raise...

272
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,149
just for your principles?

273
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,944
Mmm. When you put it that way,
it does sound a little farfetched,

274
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,946
but that's the lug
you're lookin' at!

275
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,575
And I vow to continue spending
every free minute I have...

276
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,952
crusading for safety!

277
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:47,664
Of course, I'd have a lot less of those
free minutes if you gave me the job.

278
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,460
Mmm. You're not as stupid
as you look or sound...

279
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,879
or our best
testing indicates.

280
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:58,550
- You've got the job. Now get to work!
- I'll get to work,

281
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,845
but first I have to say
good-bye to some friends.

282
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,849
- Friends,

283
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:11,063
you have come to depend on me
as your safety watchdog...

284
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:14,274
so you won't scrape yourself
or stub your toes...

285
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,276
or blow yourselves up.

286
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,279
But you can't depend on me
all your life.

287
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:23,659
you have to learn that there's
a little Homer Simpson in all of us,

288
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:27,454
and I'm going to have to live
without your respect and awe.

289
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,875
The only reason
I'm telling you this is...

290
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,378
I'm going to be leaving you.

291
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,464
- But don't worry.

292
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:42,845
I have just been appointed the new
safety inspector at this very plant...

293
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:46,974
with a big, fat raise!

294
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,353
Hey, that's my pop up there!
Dad, watch out!

295
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,774
Whoa, easy! Don't drop me.

296
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,151
- Be careful.
- Homer! Homer! Homer!

297
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,759
Shh.
