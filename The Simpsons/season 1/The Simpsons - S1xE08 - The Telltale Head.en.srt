1
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,803
You know, Bart,
when I was your age,

2
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,805
I pulled a few boners.

3
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,016
But I think you'll find
that people are pretty decent...

4
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,019
- if you give them half--
- Look! There it is--

5
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,313
- The head!
- Kill him!

6
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,418
They got us cornered, boy.
We'll never get away. Give me the head.

7
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,921
No, Dad. This whole thing
was my fault.

8
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,507
- You run along.
- Son, we're in this mess together.

9
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,009
No matter how
tempting it might be,

10
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,221
I can't let my only boy get ripped
limb from limb by a bloodthirsty mob.

11
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,432
- Aw, Dad.
- We'll die together,
like a father and son should.

12
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,434
Look.
Now we'vegot 'em.

13
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,229
- Hey, that's Homer Simpson.
- And his kid, Bart.

14
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,231
- Let's kill them!
- Bring 'em out!

15
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,942
- Off the kid, man. Off him!
- Kill Bart!

16
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,110
- Kill Homer!
- Let's kill this guy!

17
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:36,406
Murderous mob,
I beg you to spare our lives.

18
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,909
At least until you've heard
the story of how we ended up...

19
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,328
with the head
of our beloved town founder.

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,914
How long will
this story take?

21
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,209
Uh, about 23 minutes
and 5 seconds.

22
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,503
- It's too long!
- 23:05?

23
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,839
Well, all right.
Go ahead.

24
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,842
Okay. It all started
Sunday morning.

25
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:55,509
Kids!
We're late for church.

26
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,512
Kids!
We're late for church.

27
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,806
Get your butts
down here right now!

28
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,606
- Ready for inspection, Mom.
- Very nice, Maggie.

29
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,526
And, Lisa,
you look lovely.

30
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,528
Bart,
assume the position.

31
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,535
- Ohh!
- Bart.

32
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,203
Now where's your father?

33
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,205
- Phillips has broken free.
- Get 'em. Get 'em!

34
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,124
-The 50, the 40, the 30, the 20, the 10.
-Oh, no!

35
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,334
- Touchdown!
- Homer?
- D'oh!

36
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,420
A 64-yardrun!
We've got an upset in the making!

37
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,132
No, we don't.
Try being objective for once in-- Oh?

38
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,634
- Let's go, Homer.
- But you don't understand, Marge.

39
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,928
I have 50 bucks
riding on this game.

40
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,139
Homer,
you promised me.

41
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,516
- This isn't gambling, Marge.

42
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,311
- It's a lead-pipe cinch.
- Here's the kick off.

43
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,606
Wolodarsky takes it at the five.
And oh, my. He fumbles!

44
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,234
- Oh, no!
-Another touchdown!

45
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,738
- Come on.

46
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,408
Why should I feel like a traffic cop
every Sunday morning?

47
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,536
I'm just tying to get
a little goodness into the family.

48
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,831
- Where is it? The game! Where is it?

49
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,210
-Ahh!
-... got Wolodarsky open in the end zone.

50
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,921
- Catch it. Catch it.
- It's complete. Touchdown!

51
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,923
All right!

52
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,219
Oh, Doctor, we got
a barnburner here.

53
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,931
This could be the most
remarkable comeback since
Lazarus rose from the dead.

54
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,933
Laza who?

55
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,144
Come on, eveybody.
We're late.

56
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:33,023
Bart, I want you to promise me you'll
pay attention in Sunday school.

57
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,234
Bart. Bart?

58
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,028
- Bart!
- Whoa! Are you talking to me?

59
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:42,616
What's this?
A personal stereo.

60
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,744
Were you going to listen
to rock music in Sunday school?

61
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,915
- Maybe.
- Can you believe this, Homer? Homer?

62
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,544
- Homer!
- No, no, no! We stink. We stink.

63
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,838
...the 40, the 30,
the 20, the 10. Touchdown!

64
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,632
Homer, were you planning on sitting
in the car till the game was over?

65
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,844
- Maybe.
- It's because of your
irreverent attitude...

66
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,805
that Bart thinks he can sneak
headphones into Sunday school.

67
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,642
- Now move it!
- Now here's the kickoff.
Wolodarsky takes it.

68
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,644
And oh my. He fumbles!

69
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,604
Will my dog Pepper
be there?

70
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm sorry,
but the answer is no.

71
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,442
- Why not?
- Because heaven is for people.

72
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,444
What about my cat,
Snowball?

73
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,613
I'm sorry,
but the answer is no.

74
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,324
- Will there be cavemen in heaven?
- Certainly not.

75
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,743
Um, ma'am, what if you're
a really good person,

76
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,745
but you're in a really,
really bad fight...

77
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,039
and your leg gets gangrene,
and it has to be amputated.

78
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,041
Will it be waiting
for you in heaven?

79
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,836
For the last time,
Bart, yes!

80
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,841
- I'd like to begin today's
sermon, which I have entitled,

81
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,344
"Gambling,
the Eighth Deadly Sin."

82
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,930
Today is Sunday,
the Lord's day,

83
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,932
and yet,
at this vey moment,

84
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,310
millions of americans
are not in the Lord's house.

85
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,730
They're in their own house
worshipping a false idol--

86
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,107
professional football.

87
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,318
- Oh, Lord--
- It's a beautiful Sunday.

88
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,528
Perfect football weather
for this incredible game.

89
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,530
- And by the way,
this game is being brought to you...

90
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,532
by the good people
at Duffbeer.

91
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,035
You can't get enough...
of that wonderful Duff.

92
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,621
Now they're lining up
fort his crucial kick.

93
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,706
One final tick
of the clock remains.

94
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,417
If they win, it will cap
anamazing comeback.

95
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,921
But it's a 49-yardfieldgoal
into the wind.

96
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,923
Make it! Make it!
Make it! Make it!

97
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,842
- The kick is up.
- Oh, please, please, please, please!

98
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:28,430
- Holy Toledo, it's good!
- It's good! It's good! It's good!

99
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,727
It's... good to see
you all in church.

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,524
- Please, be seated, Homer.
- Yeah, sit down, Homer.

101
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:42,819
The ventriloquist goes to heaven,
but the dummy doesn't.

102
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,030
- Oh, oh, oh! Me!
- Bart?

103
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,407
What about a robot
with a human brain?

104
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,535
I don't know!
All these questions!

105
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,538
Is a little blind faith
too much to ask?

106
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,540
- Yea!

107
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,835
Don't forget next week.
Remember to read--

108
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,045
That was very nice,
Father.

109
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,006
I was pleased
you enjoyed it.

110
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,635
I seemed to have struck a chord
with you today, Homer.

111
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,720
What? Oh, yeah,
you were great.

112
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,722
- Homer.

113
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:14,434
Homer, you embarrassed us in front
of the whole congregation.

114
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,020
And today's sermon was one
you should have really listened to.

115
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,022
- What was it about?
- Gambling.

116
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,819
Oh. He didn't say that under certain
circumstances it was all right, did he?

117
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,239
No! Look. I don't want to talk about
this anymore in front of the kids.

118
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,116
Lisa, Bart,

119
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,410
what did you two learn
in Sunday school today?

120
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,620
The answers to deep
theological questions.

121
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,124
Yeah. Among other things,
apes can't get into heaven.

122
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,626
What? Those cute
little monkeys?

123
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,713
- That's terrible. Who told you that?
- Our teacher.

124
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,924
I can understand how they wouldn't
let in those wild jungle apes,

125
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,635
but what about those really
smart ones who live among us,

126
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,013
who roller-skate
and smoke cigars?

127
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,308
Oh, cool, man.
Space Mutants 4.

128
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,518
Drop me off!.
Drop me off!.

129
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,021
- No way, Jose.
- Marge, they're only space mutants.

130
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,440
Uh-uh. I know what
those movies are like.

131
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,109
Killing innocent people,
eating human flesh.

132
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,320
You'll just get
a lot of bad ideas.

133
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,240
Hey, Dad.
Can I have five bucks?

134
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,035
I hope you're not planning
to see a certain movie...

135
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,120
starring certain
space mutants...

136
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,540
that a certain mother didn't
want you to see.

137
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,834
Perish the thought.

138
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,129
Here you go, son. Share the wealth.
That's what I always say.

139
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,218
Ooh!

140
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:39,228
Da da da da da
Whoa! Whoa!

141
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,146
Ooh, cowabunga!

142
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,443
- Hey, hot dog!
- What?

143
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,820
- Nice dismount, man.

144
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,533
- Didn't hurt.
- Oh, yeah? Well, do it again.

145
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,118
Nah. Might land on my face
and end up looking like you.

146
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,120
- You little punk!

147
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,706
Hey, man, leave the kid alone.
I like him.

148
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,041
- You do?
- Yeah, you're witty.

149
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,626
- You do?
- Yeah, you're witty.

150
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,920
- So what's your name, man?
- I'm Bart Simpson.

151
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,839
This here's Kearny,
and I'm Jimbo.

152
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,716
You don't need an introduction.
You're the worst kid in school.

153
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,220
- Thanks.
- Psst. Coast is clear.

154
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,848
You guys
are sneakin' in?

155
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,726
- Yeah. Only saps pay to see movies.
- Hey, Bart, come on!

156
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,647
But sneaking into a movie is
practically stealing, man.

157
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,525
- " Practically"?
- It is stealing.

158
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,945
Well, okay. I just wanted to make sure
we weren't deluding ourselves.

159
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,125
Wait! I think
I hear something.

160
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,711
Oh, come on.
Loosen up, babe.

161
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,422
There's nobody here
but you and me.

162
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,925
No. Stop it!

163
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,429
I think I hear something...
not human.

164
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,811
Let's get romantic.

165
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,813
Well, okay.

166
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,235
You little sneaks,
you're coming with me.

167
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,530
Next time you little hoodlums
ty this, I'm calling your parents!

168
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,533
Oh, yeah? Well, we don't wanna see
your crummy movie anyway.

169
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,911
Yeah. We'll take
our business elsewhere.

170
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,913
You know, Bart.

171
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,124
I've been kicked out
of all four Space Mutant movies.

172
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,418
Wow, man.

173
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,133
Three jumbo
chery squisheys,

174
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,345
- and one double jumbo
original flavor, sir.
- Okay.

175
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,640
Don't you kids take anything.
I'm watching you.

176
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,725
- I've got eyes in the back of my head.

177
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,938
- Four fifty-two.
- Don't worry, guys. It's on me.

178
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,940
Share the wealth.
That's what I always say.

179
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,109
Guys?

180
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,819
Guys?

181
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,822
Hey, guys.
Where'd you get all that great stuff?

182
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,824
Five-finger discount,
man.

183
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:02,120
- You ripped it off?
- Yeah. Thanks for covering for us, man.

184
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:16,134
- Go on, Bart.
- But that guy founded Springfield.

185
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,346
He built our first hospital
out of logs and mud.

186
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,849
If it weren't for him,
all the settlers would have died...

187
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,309
in the great blizzard
of '48.

188
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,311
So?

189
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,607
So...

190
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,735
watch me hit him
right between the eyes.

191
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,907
What are you doing? Show a little
respect, you insolent little thugs.

192
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,535
We're really scared.

193
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:45,747
Hey! Hey, you!
Hey! Hey, you!

194
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,337
You know, when you
look up at clouds in the sky,

195
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,840
they start looking
like stuff.

196
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,634
- No, they don't.
- Yeah, they do.

197
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,846
Like that one over there
looks just like a cherry bomb.

198
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,433
Hey, you're right.
And look at that one.

199
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,936
It looks like a guy with
a switchblade stuck in his back.

200
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,022
Yeah, that one
looks like a school bus...

201
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,442
going over a cliff in flames,
with kids inside screaming.

202
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:18,739
That one looks just like the statue of
our town founder, Jebediah Springfield.

203
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,949
- Does not.
- Does too.

204
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:24,244
- I mean, without the head, of course.
- Oh, yeah.

205
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:27,331
I wish someone really would cut
his ugly old head off.

206
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,333
- You do?
- Yeah, that'd be cool.

207
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,543
Sure would cheese
eveybody off.

208
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,922
But, guys, come on.
Don't you remember history class?

209
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,342
Jebediah once killed
a bear with his bare hands.

210
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:42,846
- Oh, sorry.
- We forgot how much you love
Jebediah Springfield.

211
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,516
- Yeah, he's your boyfriend.
- Yeah!

212
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,727
- Come on, guys. Knock it off.
- Beat it, Simpson.

213
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,813
Man, I thought
you were cool.

214
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,741
Beat it, Simpson.

215
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,743
Man, I thought
you were cool.

216
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,040
Aha!

217
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,713
Wow! Look at these
bowling balls, Maggie.

218
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,843
Can you think of a better way for
Daddy to spend his hard-won 50 bucks?

219
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,930
Now I've seen everything.

220
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,850
Black marbleized
with a liquid center.

221
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,728
"The Stealth Bowler:
The pins don't know what hit them."

222
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,814
Dad, can I talk to you
about something?

223
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,816
Sure, boy.
What's on your mind?

224
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:40,612
Well, I was wondering.
How important is it to be popular?

225
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:45,409
I'm glad you asked, son.
Being popular is the most
important thing in the world.

226
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,745
So, like, sometimes you could
do stuff you think is pretty bad...

227
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,831
so other kids
will like you better?

228
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,709
- You're not talking about
killing anyone, are you?
- No.

229
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,127
- Are you?
- No!

230
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,129
Then run along,
you little scamp.

231
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,132
A boy without mischiefis like a
bowling ball without a liquid center.

232
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,111
What have I done?

233
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,124
Bart, are you allright?

234
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,544
Uh, yeah.
Top of the world, Ma.

235
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,629
Well, then come down
for breakfast.

236
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,340
- Ooh! Look at this one.

237
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,219
"The Hammer of Thor:
It will send your pins to...

238
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,930
Val-halla." Lisa?

239
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,224
Valhalla is where Vikings
go when they die.

240
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,934
Oh.
That's some ball.

241
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,019
Good morning,
eveybody.

242
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,940
We interrupt "Mamboin the Morning"...

243
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,234
to bring you
this special news bulletin.

244
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:45,737
The statue of Jebediah Springfield,
our illustrious town founder,

245
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,323
- was brutally decapitated last night...

246
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,826
in an act
of senseless vandalism.

247
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,120
We now go to Police Chief Wiggum
at City Hall.

248
00:15:55,539 --> 00:16:00,419
Well, we have no witnesses,
no suspects, and no leads.

249
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:05,841
If anyone has any information,
please dial "O" and ask for the police.

250
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,844
That number again,"O."

251
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,846
Stay tuned to this station...

252
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,932
for further developments as they break.

253
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:18,645
- It's just a statue.
- The statue of the trail blazing
founder of our town.

254
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,523
It's a symbol of what we can all do
if we put our minds to it.

255
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,317
Just a statue?

256
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,944
Is the Statue of Liberty
just a statue?

257
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,447
Is the Leaning Tower of Pizza
just a statue?

258
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,949
- Uh-oh. School bus.

259
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,118
Come on, Lis.
School bus.

260
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,622
Go on, Lisa. We've all got
to be brave, just like Jebediah...

261
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,249
- when he killed that bear.
- It's so awful.

262
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,335
Okay, come on,
come on, everybody.

263
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,921
We gotta get on
with our lives.

264
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,215
Let's ty and put
this tragedy behind us.

265
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,217
You're right, Moe.

266
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,344
A beer, please, and make sure
there's a head on it.

267
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:56,350
I said it before, and I'll say it again.

268
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,019
" Hell in a handbasket!"

269
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,647
I hope they find
the punk who did this,

270
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,441
and I hope
they cut his head off.

271
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,026
Yeah!

272
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,028
Hi, guys.
What's up?

273
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,240
We were saying we'd love to meet the
guy who cut off the head of that statue.

274
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,618
- Yeah, we wish he were here right now.

275
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,245
Oh, really?

276
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,540
Yeah, we'd break every bone
in his stupid little body.

277
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,043
- Yeah, that's right, man. Limb by limb.
- Yeah!

278
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:27,339
What? But-But yesterday,
didn't you say it would be cool...

279
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,051
to cut off the head,
and really cheese everybody off?

280
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,011
Yeah, that was
just cloud talk, man.

281
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,347
Yeah. I mean, throwing rocks
is one thing,

282
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,349
but I would never cut
the head off of a guy...

283
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,935
who iced a bear
with his bare hands.

284
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,229
-So what's in the bag, Bart?
-My head.

285
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:46,233
- I said, what's in the bag, Bart?

286
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,319
Go ahead, Bart. Tell them.

287
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,240
It's the head
of Jebediah Springfield.

288
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,950
I gotta go!

289
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,746
Look what you've done.
You wanted to be popular.

290
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,125
Now you're the most
hated boy in town.

291
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,920
You're not really talking to me.
You're just my overactive imagination.

292
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,840
- Oh, I am, am I?
- Shut up.

293
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,134
I wanted them
to like me.

294
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,344
Hmm.
The child seems rattled.

295
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:17,514
- Can you blame him?
- No. No, I can't.

296
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,227
There, there, Mr. Burns.
Blow, sir.

297
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,317
Hey, Bart,
where are you going?

298
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,320
- Uh, to my room.
- Why don't you watch Krusty the Clown?

299
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:36,325
There's someone out there in Krustyland
who has committed an atrocity.

300
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,036
If you know who cut off
Jebediah's head--

301
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,831
I don't care if it's your brother,
your sister, your daddy or your mommy--

302
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,250
turn them in,
and Krusty will send you...

303
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:49,213
- a free slide whistle
just like Sideshow Bob's.

304
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,052
- Wait a minute.

305
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,138
I hope you're not planning to do
what I think you're doing.

306
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,933
Sorry, man.
It's either you or me.

307
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:04,728
You know, Bart, you don't
have to found a town to be a hero.

308
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,939
Sometimes a hero
could be a young boy...

309
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:11,318
with the courage to stand up
and admit he's made a mistake.

310
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,946
Yeah, well, I'm running
a little short on courage right now.

311
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,948
Aah!

312
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,742
Anyway, think about it,
will you, son?

313
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,416
Jebediah Obediah
Zachariahjedediah Springfield...

314
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,418
came West in 1838.

315
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,420
Along the way,
he met a ferocious bear...

316
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,422
and killed him
with his bare hands.

317
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,217
That's " B-A-R-E" hands.

318
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,928
Although modern historians
recently uncovered evidence...

319
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,430
that the bear, in fact,
probably killed him.

320
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,017
- But whether bear killed man--
- Mom. Dad.

321
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,521
- I knew it all along!
- Why, Bart? Why?

322
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,523
Yeah, why?
You little--

323
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:53,026
Because I wanted
some really bad kids to like me.

324
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,612
Somehow I got the idea
that being popular...

325
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,614
was the most important
thing in the world.

326
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:01,743
- Where did you get
a ridiculous idea like that?
- Uh--

327
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,745
Lay off
the boy, Marge.

328
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,040
He's a good kid.
Quit giving him the third degree.

329
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,043
Homer, did you have
something to do with this?

330
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,713
Well, maybe I am
a little responsible.

331
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,424
- A little?
- Come on, son.

332
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,552
Let's take the head thing
back to the authorities.

333
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,015
You know, Bart,
when I was your age,

334
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,017
I pulled a few boners.

335
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:27,227
But I think you'll find people
are pretty decent...

336
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,147
- if you give them half--
- Look! There it is--

337
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,441
- The head!
- Kill 'em!

338
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,951
-Allright. Allright.
- Allright, already.

339
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:46,246
- We know this part.
-Oh, yeah, right.

340
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,248
Well, that's my story.

341
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,919
And if you still wanna tear apart
this young Sunday school student...

342
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,838
as he stands on the brink
of salvation,

343
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:58,133
- I await your wrath.
- Aw!

344
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:02,638
- Somehow I don't feel
like killing anymore.
- Neither do I.

345
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,515
Dad.

346
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,645
- Forgive me, sir.
- No problem, Bart.

347
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,022
Look!
It's glorious.

348
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,233
It's beautiful, man.

349
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,653
- I love you, Smithers.
- The feeling is more than mutual, sir.

350
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,115
Whoo!

351
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,827
Good going, son.

352
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:26,829
But remember--
Most lynch mobs aren't this nice.

353
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:37,316
Shh!
