2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,902
Froggie, I'm home!

3
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:46,379
Hi, little fella.
I got some nice juicy flies for you.

4
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,182
Geez, Louise.
Look at this mess.

5
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:52,485
I told that boy a billion times
to pick up his jun--

6
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:59,425
I like to play with you.

7
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:01,427
- My back.
- I like to play with you.

8
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:04,197
- There goes my back again.
- I like to play with you.

9
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:08,701
I like to play with you.
I like to play with you.

10
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:11,204
- I like to play with you.
- Go get help, boy.

11
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:15,575
I like to play with you.
I like to play with you.

12
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:18,311
I like to play with you.

13
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:23,883
- I like to play with you.
- Oh, Maggie. My poor back.

14
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:28,254
I like to play with you.

15
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:32,692
I like to p--
I like to play--

16
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,594
- Dad!

17
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:36,596
Homer, what happened?

18
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:40,700
Oh, the boy.
Bring me the boy.

19
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,737
Bart, if you had cleaned up
your room when I asked you to,

20
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:46,173
your father's trick back
would still be aligned.

21
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:49,075
So, you'll pick up
this mess right now.

22
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,478
Clumsy Homer.

23
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:54,548
Everything's always my fault.

24
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:57,284
If he'd just watch out
where he was going.

25
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,285
Hello. What have we here?

26
00:02:58,285 --> 00:02:59,853
Hello. What have we here?

27
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:02,155
A cherry bomb.

28
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:04,558
I thought I blew
all you guys up.

29
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:09,429
People, people, no rough-housing
on the monkey bars.

30
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:12,666
You there. Tuck in your shirt.
Watch it. I saw that.

31
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,637
You certainly have done
awfully well for yourself, Spanky.

32
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:20,040
Mother, please don't call me Spanky
on school grounds.

33
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:23,510
- Wow! A cherry bomb!
- What are you going
to do with it, Bart?

34
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,646
- Watch out, Bart. It's Skinner!
- Uh-oh.

35
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,983
Good morning, Mr. Skinner.

36
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,952
Morning, boys.

37
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,955
Why haven't you introduced me
to your students, Spanky?

38
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:39,159
- Well?
- Mother, I would like you to meet...

39
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:44,064
Milhouse, Lewis, Richard
and Bart Simpson.

40
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:46,767
This is the Bart Simpson
you're always talking about?

41
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,336
- Mm-hmm.
- But he looks so sweet.

42
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:53,440
- I am, Ma'am.
- Simpson! Let's move on
now, Mother, shall we?

43
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:55,442
Bye, Spanky.

44
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,846
So, you're gonna flush it?

45
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,148
What can I say?
I've got a weakness for the classics.

46
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:04,018
I think I need to make a stop
at the little girls' room.

47
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,921
Okay, Mother. This way.

48
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:11,459
So long, sucker.

49
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:21,235
- Now hold it right there,
you little-- Mother?
- Spanky?

50
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,238
Oh, Marge, I still hurt.

51
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:27,542
Marge. Marge!

52
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,912
Oh, Homer. How many times
do I have to fluff your pillow?

53
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:34,048
Actually, I was wondering if you
could make me a grilled cheese sandwich.

54
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:37,185
- Well, okay.
- Make sure it's squished flat
and crunchy on the outside.

55
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,320
I know how you like 'em, Homer.

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,923
And maybe some of those
little wieners that come in a can?

57
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,625
Oh, and some fruit cocktail
in heavy syrup.

58
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:51,032
Marge.

59
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:53,001
Marge.

60
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,638
Marge, get the door!

61
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,576
Principal Skinner!

62
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,578
Hello, Mrs. Simpson.
I'm afraid there's been...

63
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:06,314
- a very disturbing incident
at school today.
- I'm outta here.

64
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,584
Homer, Principal Skinner is here.

65
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:13,321
Hello, Principal Skinner.
I'd get up, but the boy crippled me.

66
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:15,323
Mm-hmm.
I understand completely.

67
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,292
The disturbing incident I was
referring to happened this morning...

68
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:21,396
when your son flushed an explosive
device down the boys' lavatory.

69
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,898
- That ol' gag.
- Unfortunately, at the same moment,

70
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:26,901
my mother was in the girls' lavatoy
making use of the facilities.

71
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,104
- Oh, dear.
- Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,

72
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,206
we have transcended incorrigible.

73
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,109
I don't think suspension
or expulsion will do the trick.

74
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:37,479
I think it behooves us all
to consider... deportation.

75
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:41,149
Deportation? You mean
kick Bart out of the country?

76
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:46,288
- Hear him out, Marge.
- Well, perhaps I was being
a tad glib. Let me explain.

77
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:49,691
Our elementary school participates
in a foreign exchange program.

78
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,995
Normally, a student is selected
on the basis of academic
excellence or intelligence,

79
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:57,566
but in Bart's case,
I'm prepared to make a big exception.

80
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:00,802
And if you're willing to play along,
he can spend the next three months...

81
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,105
studying far, far away.

82
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:06,508
Sounds great. Although, a kid
can't learn much in just three months.

83
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,810
Homer, you didn't even ask
where Bart would be going.

84
00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:10,812
Actually, he'd be staying
in France,

85
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,315
in a lovely chateau
in the heart of the wine county.

86
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,250
But Bart doesn't speak French.

87
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:17,252
Oh, when he's totally immersed
in a foreign language,

88
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,988
- the average child
can become fluent in weeks.
- Yeah, but what about Bart?

89
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:22,090
I'm sure he'll pick up
enough to get by.

90
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,059
And, uh, the whole thing
won't cost you a dime,

91
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:26,061
as long as you're willing
to take in a student of your own.

92
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:28,063
Wait a minute, Skinner.

93
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:30,065
How do we know
some principal in France...

94
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,367
isn't pulling
the same scam you are?

95
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:36,205
For one thing, you wouldn't
be getting a French boy.
You'd be getting an Albanian.

96
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,340
- You mean all white with pink eyes?
- No. No, no, no.

97
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:42,144
A student from Albania.
It's a county on the Adriatic Sea.

98
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,180
Well, going to France
sounds like a fantastic opportunity,

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,483
but I think Bart
should have a say in this.

100
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:51,453
The life of a frog.
That's the life for me.

101
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:56,559
Bart, how would you like to spend
the next three months living in France?

102
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,662
France? Wow!

103
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:02,364
He makes me crazy
12 months a year.

104
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:04,467
- At least you get the summer off.
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,536
- And I get to take a plane
there, wouldn't I, Mom?
- Yes, Bart.

106
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:09,672
- Wow! And one back?
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:13,376
Well, Bart seems very enthusiastic
about the idea.

108
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,479
- Yes, baby!
- Way to go!

109
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,647
Bon voyage, boy.

110
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,823
Good-bye, my special--
my special little guy.

111
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:30,259
You will write us, won't you?

112
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,261
- All the time.
- What do you know about France?

113
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:34,297
I know I'm going,
and you're not.

114
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,265
I'm gonna miss you, son.

115
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:38,935
And listen, while you're seeing
all those great sights,

116
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:42,472
always remember that
you're representing your county.

117
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:44,440
I guess what I'm saying is,

118
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:47,076
don't mess up France
the way you messed up your room.

119
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:50,046
- Okay, Dad.
- Is one of you going to be
on the charter flight?

120
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:52,148
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hmm. Come along.

121
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:54,450
- Bye.
- Be good.
- We'll miss you.

122
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:31,621
Hey, man, watch it.
Ooh! Oh! Ow!

123
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:36,926
Oh! Hey, man.
It's me, Bart Simpson.

124
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:38,828
- Okay, kid. Let's go.
- Hey!

125
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:41,631
Every little breeze
seems to whisper Louise

126
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:46,036
Birds in the trees
seem to
Louise

127
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:49,806
La la la laa
La la la la la
Ooh la la!

128
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,242
How much longer, sir?

129
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:54,244
This is where
we're going, right?

130
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:57,380
Chateau Mah-son.

131
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,427
Eww. What a dump.

132
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:18,001
You know, in Albania, the unit
of currency is called The lek.

133
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,704
You gotta be kiddin'. The lek.

134
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,507
And the national flag is
a two-headed eagle on a red field.

135
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:25,809
Give me the old
stars and stripes.

136
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:28,779
And the main export is
furious political thought.

137
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:31,281
- Political what?
- Trans Albanian Airlines,
flight number two,

138
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,417
Tirana to Springfield,
is now arriving.

139
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:35,452
Welcome to your new home.

140
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,387
Escape is impossible.

141
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:40,224
My name is Cesar.
This is my nephew, Ugolin.

142
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,593
You may find life here
at the chateau hard,

143
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,596
but if you shut up
and do exactly what we say,

144
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:47,598
the time will pass
more quickly.

145
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:50,901
- He's right, you know.
- Well, okay, sir.

146
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:56,607
- Adil?
- Mother?

147
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:59,710
Well, I guess for the next few months,
yes, I will be your mother.

148
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:03,380
And this must be Lisa and Maggie.

149
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,485
And you must be
my new father, Homer.

150
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:10,187
Affectionate little Albanian,
isn't he?

151
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,701
Hey, come on, guys.
Quit being so grabby.

152
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:26,871
Sorry, man. Be my guest.

153
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:30,174
You may find his accent peculiar.

154
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:33,010
Certain aspects of his culture
may seem absurd,

155
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,146
perhaps even offensive.

156
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:38,316
But I urge you all to give little Adil
the benefit of the doubt.

157
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:41,118
In this way,
and only in this way,

158
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:44,956
can we hope to better understand our
backward neighbors throughout the world.

159
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,627
Thank you, Principal Skinner.

160
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:51,596
Thank you, fellow students.

161
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:54,766
Although I have only been
in your county a few days,

162
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,470
I have already found Americans
to be most... trusting.

163
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:02,073
Although, officially,
I am required to hate you,

164
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:05,209
I want you to know
I do not feel it in my heart.

165
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,855
Hurry up, boy. My grapes
are waiting for their water.

166
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:23,261
How can you defend a country...

167
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:26,564
where 5% of the people
control 95% of the wealth?

168
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:31,136
I'm defending a county
where people can think, act
and worship anyway they want.

169
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:33,671
- Can not. Can not.
- Can too. Can too.

170
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:36,875
Please, please, kids.
Stop fighting.

171
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:40,145
Maybe Lisa's right about America
being a land of opportunity,

172
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:42,681
and maybe Adil has a point
about the machinery of capitalism...

173
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:44,983
being oiled with the blood
of the workers.

174
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:48,553
Your father is right.
We should not fight. Friends?

175
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:50,855
Well, okay.

176
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:53,358
Well, now that that's settled,
I'll just clear the dishes.

177
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:56,628
No, no, Mrs. Simpson. You have been
oppressed enough for today.

178
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:59,264
- I will clear the dishes.
- Oh. Okay.

179
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:02,067
Did you see that?

180
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,770
You know, Marge, this is the way
I've always wanted it to be.

181
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:07,639
We've become
a fully functioning family unit.

182
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,641
We've always blamed ourselves,

183
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:12,544
but I guess it's pretty clear
which cylinder wasn't firing.

184
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:15,080
- Homer!
- Your paper-thin commitment
to your children...

185
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:17,049
sends shivers down my spine.

186
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,151
- May I be excused?
- Lisa!

187
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:21,653
Oh, she's just jealous.
She'll get over it.

188
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,656
And if she doesn't,
we can always exchange her.

189
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,825
- Homer!
- Just kidding.

190
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:32,965
Can I have something
to go with my turnip?

191
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:36,034
Quiet! When you work like a man,
we will feed you like one.

192
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:39,338
Now go to sleep!

193
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:46,245
Hey, hey, come on.
Move it, pal.

194
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:49,415
You leave Maurice alone.
The floor is good enough for you.

195
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:51,417
You go to sleep there.

196
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:01,827
- Nice and cozy, Adil?
- Yes. Thank you, Father.

197
00:13:01,927 --> 00:13:03,929
Look, Adil, you can call me Dad.

198
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:05,931
All right, Dad.

199
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:08,400
Aw! You called me Dad.

200
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,137
Dad, do you think I could come visit you
at the nuclear power plant?

201
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:15,241
- You wanna see where I work?
- Oh, yes, very much.

202
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:18,944
None of my biological kids
ever wanted to see me at work.

203
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,447
- Then I can go?
- Well, I'll have to pull
a few strings...

204
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:24,717
with the boys in security,
but sure, you bet.

205
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,219
Excellent.

206
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:29,255
Now watch me.

207
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:32,091
You grab the grape
between your thumb and forefinger...

208
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:36,329
and gently twist it off
and drop it in the bucket.

209
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:38,331
Now you do it.

210
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:42,301
Very good.
Now do it a million times.

211
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:45,137
See these? American doughnuts.

212
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:48,407
Glazed, powdered
and raspberry-filled.

213
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:52,111
Now how's that for freedom of choice?

214
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:55,715
Dad, do you think I might see
your plutonium isolation module?

215
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:58,918
Uh... maybe.
Hold on a second.

216
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,920
- Hey, Lenny.
- Hmm?

217
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,089
Does this place have one of
those plutonium isolation deals?

218
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:05,291
- Yeah, over in sector 12.
- Sector 12?

219
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:08,995
- Third floor, by the candy machines.
- Oh, that sector 12.

220
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:11,397
Come along, Adil.

221
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:18,404
Ungrateful swine!

222
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:20,506
We give you food,
we give you shelter,

223
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,809
and this is how you repay us!

224
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:27,180
You little shutterbug.

225
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:35,188
Cheese!

226
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:37,190
Cheese!

227
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,192
Oh, wait a minute.

228
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:41,895
Stupid grapes.

229
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:45,265
Bunch of creeps!
I hate France!

230
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,705
You sure have taken a shine
to little Adil.

231
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:55,375
Well, he sure makes life a lot easier
around here. You have to admit that.

232
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:58,178
Well, okay, I will,
if you admit you love Bart.

233
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:00,814
Okay. Okay.
I love Bart.

234
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,782
- Well?
- What?

235
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,651
Well?

236
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,387
Oh, Adil's a very sweet boy.

237
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:09,322
Darn tootin'.

238
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:44,124
"Dear Bart, How is France?"

239
00:15:44,258 --> 00:15:46,160
I don't know why
you haven't written.

240
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,362
"I guess you're just
having too much fun."

241
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:52,566
- Oh, yeah, right.
- Silence!

242
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:55,969
"Everyone here
in the United States is fine."

243
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,573
We think Maggie may say
her first word any day now.

244
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,642
Lisa got an A in math,

245
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:05,245
which I'm only mentioning as news.
I'm not putting you down.

246
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:10,651
And your father, well...
last night, he went to sleep...

247
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,354
"talking about
how much he loves you."

248
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:16,023
Oh.

249
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:19,326
"Remember to dress warm and try
to be as helpful as you can..."

250
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,362
to your adopted parents.

251
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:23,731
"All my love. Mom."

252
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:27,268
Oh.

253
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,034
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

254
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:02,170
Sorry.

255
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:07,942
On second thought, Bart.
Bart, come here.

256
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:14,916
- Drink this.
- No, thanks.

257
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,352
Do not worry.
This is France.

258
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:20,888
It is customary for children
to take a little wine now and then.

259
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:23,124
Yeah, but it's got
antifreeze in there.

260
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:26,227
- Drink it!
- Oh!

261
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:44,412
Ooh!

262
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:46,414
Oh, Bart.

263
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:56,725
Oh.

264
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:08,170
You're a policeman, aren't you?

265
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:10,605
Excusez-moi.
Jeneparlepas Anglais.

266
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:14,843
But you gotta help me.
These two guys I'm staying with,
they work me day and night.

267
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,312
They don't feed me.
They make me sleep on the--

268
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:22,117
I--
I don't want a piece of candy.

269
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:25,787
I need your--

270
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,923
Come on, Mister.
Can you help me?

271
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:32,394
Oh, forget it.

272
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,997
I'm so stupid.

273
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:38,100
Anybody could have learned
this dumb language by now.

274
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,502
Here I've listened to nothing
but French for the past...

275
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:13,969
Honey, I'm home.

276
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,872
Hello, Homer.
What's that?

277
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:18,874
Oh, just some blueprints
Adil wanted.

278
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:21,677
I'm telling you,
he's such a curious little dickens.

279
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:25,581
I bet he could build
a nuclear power plant if he wanted to.

280
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:28,784
All right, Sparrow.
We know you're in there.

281
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:30,853
We'll give you one minute
to surrender.

282
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:33,856
Oh, my!

283
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:38,160
Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood.
Let's check it out.

284
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,363
I'm his neighbor.
What did he do?

285
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:43,766
Well, sir, we--
Well, sir, we've been on the trail...

286
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,369
of a spy transmitting
highly confidential information...

287
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,371
- to an unfriendly nation.
- Ooh!

288
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:50,473
Mm-hmm. Through the use
of radio triangulation,

289
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,643
- we tracked him to exactly this point.
- Wow.

290
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:55,678
- That's all I can tell you.
- Aw.

291
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:57,747
All right. Well, the name of
his county starts with the letter "A."

292
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,849
- Hmm. Ooh!
- Time's up, Sparrow.

293
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:01,651
We're coming in after you.

294
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:04,954
Oh, gee whiz. Adil would get
a kick out of seeing this.

295
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:06,989
- Adil?
- The Sparrow!

296
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,462
Adil. Oh, there you are.

297
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,964
Get him!

298
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,549
Au revoir, suckers.

299
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,758
So, he's going to prison?

300
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:45,728
No. We've arranged an exchange for
one of our own men caught in Albania.

301
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,832
So, Sparrow, we meet again.

302
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:52,235
Yes. Sometimes I think
I am getting too old for this game.

303
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,237
Okay, kids.
Let's hurry it up.

304
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,973
Good-bye, Simpsons.
Thank you for your hospitality.

305
00:20:56,973 --> 00:21:01,611
I hope this experience will not sour you
on the student exchange program.

306
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,516
- Good-bye, Adil.
- Have a nice trip.

307
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:11,121
Good-bye, Adil. I'll send you
those civil defense plans you wanted.

308
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:13,723
Air France, flight
dix-neufcentquatre-vingtshuit,

309
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,226
Paris to Springfield,
is now arriving.

310
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,864
Look, Mom. There he is!

311
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,934
- Oh, Bart, my baby boy. Welcome home.
- Hey, where's the big guy?

312
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,737
He means me.

313
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:28,739
- Hey, boy.
- Hey, Homer.

314
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:32,109
He brought us gifts.
His first unselfish act.

315
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,946
So, basically, I met
one nice French person.

316
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:39,516
Bart, I have something to say that's
gonna bother me if I don't say it.

317
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,885
- It's good to see you.
- Same here.

318
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:45,322
I'd love a glass
of that wine Bart brought us.

319
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:48,825
Sorry, Marge. Some wise guy
stuck a cork in the bottle.

320
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:55,532
You hear that, Marge?
My boy speaks French.

322
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:05,803
Shh!
