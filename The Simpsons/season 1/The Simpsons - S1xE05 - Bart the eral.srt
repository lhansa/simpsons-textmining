1
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:17,581
Do I smell cupcakes?

2
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:20,846
- Ooh! Do I ever!
-Uh-uh, Homer.

3
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:23,367
Lisa's making these
for her teacher.

4
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,694
Ah. Say no more.

5
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:29,087
- Yum! Don't mind ifl do.
- Bart!

6
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,511
- Oh, man!
Keep your greasy mitts outta there.

7
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:34,645
- These are for Lisa's class.
- It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday.

8
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:37,070
- you know, there are names
for people like you.
- No, there aren't.

9
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:40,431
- Teacher's pet,
apple polisher, butt kisser--
- Bart!

10
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:43,728
- You're saying "buttkisser"
like it's a bad thing.
- Huh?

11
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:49,836
Well, you see, boy, it never hurts
to grease the wheels a little.

12
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad.
I like my teacher.

13
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:54,878
Sure, Lis.
you see how it works, Bart?

14
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:57,204
A cupcake here,
a good grade there.

15
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:02,916
Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart
and I pay attention and I study hard.

16
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:06,710
Yeah, right, Lisa.
It's the three roads to success, Bart:

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,806
work, brains and hmm--

18
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,604
Oh, brother.

19
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:13,900
- Uh-oh, school bus. Gotta go.

20
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:16,698
Heh-heh-heh.
Doh!

21
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:21,590
- Yo, Ottoman!
- Yo, Bart dude!

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,554
Hey, can you
believe it, man?

23
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:26,384
My sister here made a whole pile
up cupcakes to butter up her teacher,

24
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:29,380
and she won't give anybody else
even one measly little crumb.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,344
That's bad news, man.

26
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:33,974
Here, Otto.
I made an extra one for you.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,837
- Oh, thanks, little lady.
- You're welcome.

28
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,633
- Whoa!

29
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,063
- Better let me hold these, Lis.
- Forget it.

30
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,059
- you sniveling toad!
you little egg sucker!
- Tell me more.

31
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:47,555
Back-scratcher. Foot-licker.
Honor student!

32
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,352
You'll never get one now,
Mr. Name-caller.

33
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:54,046
All right, all right.
Look, I'm sory. I-I got upset.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,209
In the heat of the moment,
I said some things I didn't mean.

35
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:59,406
- you weren't thinking, were you?
-No.

36
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:02,402
-I'm not a sniveling toad, am I?
-Not really.

37
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:04,499
I'm not a little
egg sucker, am I?

38
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,829
- Of course not.
- Then what am I?

39
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:11,124
- A beautiful human being.
- What do you like best about me?

40
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,920
Well, I'd have to say...

41
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:16,783
your generous nature,
your spirit of giving.

42
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:20,412
Well--

43
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:24,206
Open your mouth and close your eyes,
and you will get a big surprise.

44
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:26,203
Ahh!

45
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:32,694
Thanks, Lis.
You're the best.

46
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:37,255
- Look, Janey. Cupcakes.
- Ah, give me that!

47
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,752
Hey, give those back!

48
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:43,646
- Hey, what's the big idea?
That's my sister, man.
- So what?

49
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:46,842
So give her back those cupcakes
before I knock your block off.

50
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:49,439
Don't, Bart!
He's a friend of Nelson Muntz!

51
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,061
Ooh!

52
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:58,693
Ooh!

53
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:02,122
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

54
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:04,718
Wha--

55
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,815
Nelson,
you're bleeding.

56
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:11,010
Nah, happens all the time.
Somebody else's blood splatters on me.

57
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,606
Hey, wait a minute.

58
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:17,268
You're right.
you made me bleed my own blood!

59
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:23,560
It was an accident, man. A terrible,
ghastly mistake. Ask anybody.

60
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,853
Uh-oh.
A cold wind.

61
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:31,549
Hello, kids.
Everything above the board here?

62
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:33,680
Good. Play friendly,
children.

63
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,977
- Uh-oh, there's your bell.

64
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:38,973
Come along, now, all of you.
No dawdling, now.

65
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:42,468
- I'll get you after school, man.
- But--

66
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:44,465
No, no, no.
He'll get you after school, son.

67
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:47,061
- Now hurry up. It's time for class.
- But--

68
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:50,357
Scoot, young Simpson.
There's learning afoot.

69
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:02,141
Okay, Nelson,
put up your dukes!

70
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:04,338
Whaa!

71
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,931
Yikes!
Uh-uh-uh!

72
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:13,492
Ha, ha, ha!

73
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,585
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Oh.

74
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:25,976
Aah!

75
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:29,704
- Uh-oh. Stop!
- Mmm!

76
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,698
Lunchtime!
Ha, ha, ha!

77
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:36,361
- Lunchtime!
- Aah!

78
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:39,990
Lunchtime, Bart.
It's lunchtime.

79
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,853
I ain't gonna get out
of the fourth grade alive.

80
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:45,949
You've gotta tell
Principal Skinner, Bart.

81
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:47,946
I can't squeal.

82
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:50,543
It would violate the
code of the schoolyard.

83
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:52,540
Hey, everybody!

84
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,636
Here comes my brother,
Bart the bully-killer!

85
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:58,432
- Yeah!
- You're our hero, Bart!

86
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,628
Look, eveybody. I would just as soon
not make a big deal out of this.

87
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,625
I'm not sayin'
I'm not a hero.

88
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:06,522
I'm just saying that
I fear for my safety.

89
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:13,212
Look out!

90
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,276
Nelson, it was
all a mistake.

91
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:17,306
This is how it
happened, man.

92
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:19,570
Listen up.
you may get a kick out of it.

93
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,800
My sister was making cupcakes
this morning and--

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,564
I'll see you
at the flagpole at 3:15.

95
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,561
And you better
be prompt.

96
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,590
He has four other beatings
scheduled this afternoon.

97
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:38,845
Good-bye,
little dude.

98
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:41,475
- He looks so lifelike, man.
- Yes.

99
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,871
The school nurse did
a wonderful job...

100
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:47,432
- reconstructing his little face
after the fight.

101
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:49,763
Good-bye, son.
I guess you were right.

102
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,060
All that homework
was a waste of your time.

103
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,723
Thanks, Bart.
We got the day off from school for this.

104
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,153
- Yeah, and I got
the day off from work.
- Homer!

105
00:05:57,153 --> 00:06:01,713
Who wants a day off from work when I'm
never gonna see my beloved son again?

106
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:05,209
Oh, Bart!
Oh, Bart!

107
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:07,206
That's better,
Homer.

108
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,802
Be brave.
Bye-bye, Bart.

109
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:15,129
you were always my special little guy.

110
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:20,289
Bart, here's that
cupcake you wanted.

111
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,784
I can't help but think ifl had just
given it to you in the first place,

112
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:27,279
this whole horrible tragedy
could have been avoided.

113
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,277
I know you can't
eat it now,

114
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:33,271
so I'll just place it
lovingly on your forehead.

115
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:36,367
Hey, look.
They got food at this thing.

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,997
- Here's one for the road, dude.

117
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:53,344
- Aah!
- Put 'em up.

118
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:05,728
Oh! Boy, you sure
taught me a lesson.

119
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:08,224
Whoo.
Thanks, guys.

120
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:11,720
I guess now all that's left
is a hearty handshake.

121
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:14,516
Right, guys?

122
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,578
I'm gonna get you again
tomorrow, Simpson.

123
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:20,574
- Is 3:15 good for you?

124
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,572
Uh, not really.

125
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,602
Too bad.

126
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:28,297
Oh, no.

127
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,159
Oh, man,
that guy's tough to love.

128
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:48,070
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

129
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:51,066
- Tough day at school, boy?
- Bart, what happened to you?

130
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:55,560
Let's just say I paid the inevitable
price for helping out my sister.

131
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,357
So, you had a little
scuffle, eh? Heh-heh.

132
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,954
Hope you won.

133
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,449
I'm gonna miss you,
big guy.

134
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,306
Bart, your mother
has the fool idea...

135
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,602
that you're upset
about something.

136
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:18,796
Dad, I need help.
Please. Oh.

137
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:21,093
Now come on, Bart.

138
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,389
We don't want your mother
to see you cying.

139
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:25,387
- Here.
- Oh, man.

140
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,383
Let me help you
dy those tears.

141
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,877
So what's
the problem, son?

142
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:36,505
- I had a run-in with a bully.
- A bully?

143
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:39,302
Come on, Marge! I don't bug
you when you're helping Lisa.

144
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:42,664
Well, Bart, I hope you're going
straight to the principal about this.

145
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,661
I guess
I could do that.

146
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:48,955
What? And violate the code of
the schoolyard? I'd rather Bart died.

147
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:51,086
What on earth are you
talking about, Homer?

148
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:53,250
The code of the
schoolyard, Marge.

149
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,946
The rules that teach a boy to be a man.
Let's see.

150
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:59,874
Don't tattle. Always make fun
of those different from you.

151
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,872
Never say anything...

152
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:04,934
unless you're sure everyone feels
exactly the same way you do.

153
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:07,297
- What else?
- Homer, that's ridiculous.

154
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:12,524
Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you
try a little understanding?

155
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,021
- What do you mean, Mom?
- Yeah, right.

156
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,317
- This oughta be good for a laugh.
- Shh!

157
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:20,446
This bully friend of yours,
is he a little on the chunky side?

158
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:23,309
- Yeah, he's pretty chunkified,
all right.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,873
And I'll bet he doesn't do well
in his studies, either.

160
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:28,801
No, he's pretty dumb. He's in all
the same special classes I am.

161
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,497
- That's why he lashes out at the world.
- Oh, Marge.

162
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:35,792
So tomorrow, instead of bickering
with this boy, talk to him.

163
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:38,289
You'll be surprised how far
a little understanding will go.

164
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:41,584
Well, thank you very much,
Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi.

165
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:44,081
- Let's go, boy.

166
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:47,743
Now here's that bully of yours.
Show me your stuff.

167
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:54,068
No, no! Not like that!
Like this!

168
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:03,456
See that, boy?

169
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:06,018
you didn't expect that, did you?
And neither will he.

170
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:08,449
you mean I should
fight dirty, Dad?

171
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,446
Unfortunately, son,
we Simpsons...

172
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:13,508
sometimes have to bend the rules
a little in order to hold our own.

173
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:15,107
Amen.

174
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,603
So the next time this bully thinks
you're gonna throw a punch,

175
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,733
you throw a glob
of mud in his eyes!

176
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,230
And then you sock him when
he's staggerin' around blinded!

177
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,393
- Yeah!
- And there's nothing wrong...

178
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,591
with hitting someone
when his back is turned.

179
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:29,021
- Gotcha.
- And if you get the chance,

180
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,318
get him right
in the familyjewels.

181
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:35,512
That little doozy's been
a Simpson trademark for generations.

182
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:37,676
Thanks, Pop.

183
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,170
- Whoa!
- Put 'em up!

184
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,166
Ha!
Ooh!

185
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:50,093
Remember
the familyjewels, son.

186
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:55,552
Hmm?

187
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:59,880
Oh, no, boys.
Not the can, please.

188
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,810
- Doh!

189
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,099
Bart, you can't
go on like this.

190
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,096
I know.

191
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,426
- Why don't you go see Grandpa?
- What can he do?

192
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:17,523
He'll give you good advice.
He's the toughest Simpson alive.

193
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,520
- He is?
- Yeah.

194
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,517
Remember the fight he put up
when we put him in the home?

195
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:22,017
Remember the fight he put up
when we put him in the home?

196
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:26,011
I'm here
to see Grandpa.

197
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,507
Half the people here
are named Grandpa.

198
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,002
- Well, Grandpa Simpson then.

199
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:35,665
Second floor, third
dank room on the left.

200
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:37,462
Thanks, lady.

201
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:39,892
" Dear Advertisers,

202
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,952
I am disgusted with the way
old people are depicted on television.

203
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:49,080
We are not all vibrant,
fun-loving sex maniacs.

204
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,741
Many of us are bitter,
resentful individuals...

205
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,238
who remember
the good old days...

206
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:58,967
when entertainment
was bland and inoffensive.

207
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,729
The following
is a list of words...

208
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,258
I never want to hear
on television again.

209
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,154
Number one: bra.

210
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,618
Number two: horny.

211
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,314
Number three:
familyjewels."

212
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:16,111
- Hi, Grandpa!
- Bart, what brings youhere?

213
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:18,108
I need some advice,
Grandpa.

214
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,803
See, there's this bully at school
who keeps beating me up.

215
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:23,800
Let me tell you
somethin', boy.

216
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,830
If youdon't
stand up foryourself,

217
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,393
bullies are gonna be pickin' on you
for the rest of your life.

218
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:30,324
Simpson, give me
your newspaper!

219
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:33,320
- Why should I?
- I wanna do the crossword puzzle.

220
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,318
No, I want to do
the crossword puzzle!

221
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:37,681
- I said, give me that puzzle.
- No.

222
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:39,978
- Give me! Give me!
- No! No!

223
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,601
Heh-heh-heh.

224
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,064
Well, I guess I can't help you,
but I know someone who can.

225
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,889
- Here?
- Yep, this is it.

226
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:58,819
What's the password?

227
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:02,348
- Let me in, you idiot!
- Yeah, right you are.

228
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,676
So, Herman, has the
large-type edition...

229
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,240
of this month's Soldier Of Fortune
come in yet?

230
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,238
No, not yet.

231
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:14,331
- Can I interest you in
some authentic Nazi underpants?
- No!

232
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:18,027
Actually, we came over because
I want you to meet my grandson, Bart.

233
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:20,124
Ah. Hello,
young American.

234
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:23,120
Hello, sir.
Uh, Mr. Herman?

235
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:25,117
- Yes?

236
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:27,515
Did you lose your arm
in the war?

237
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:30,410
My arm? Well,
let me put it this way.

238
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,970
Next time your teacher tells you
to keep your arm inside
the bus window, you do it!

239
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:36,602
Yes, sir,
I will.

240
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:39,897
Bart's got a problem with
a local young bully named Nelson.

241
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:42,760
I thought you could help him
with some kind of strategy.

242
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:46,255
Strategy. Hmm.
How many men do you have?

243
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,253
- None.
- You'll need more.

244
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:52,181
And you'll need to train them hard!
Now, let's see.

245
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,245
Ah. Okay.

246
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:57,840
The key to Springfield
has always been Elm Street.

247
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,968
The Greeks knew it. The Carthaginians
knew it. Now you know it.

248
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,465
First you'll need
a declaration of war.

249
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:09,325
Uh, ah! That way, eveything
you do will be nice and legal.

250
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,820
Okay, I can use this one
from the Franco-Prussian War.

251
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:17,314
I'll just change "Otto von Bismarck"
to read " Bart Simpson."

252
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:19,744
- Psst!

253
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:23,606
- Grandpa, I think this
guy's a little nuts.
- Oh, yeah?

254
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:26,901
Well, General George S. Patton
was a little nuts.

255
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,030
And this guy is completely
out of his mind.

256
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:32,826
We can't fail!

257
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:45,410
Psst!
Pass it on!

258
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,969
So, Mister,
what are we doin' here anyway?

259
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:52,966
I wonder
where Bart is.

260
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,962
Yeah. It's way past
1500 hours.

261
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:03,053
Okay, we all know
why we're here, right?

262
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:06,049
- No. Why?
- To fight Nelson the bully.

263
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:10,143
That guy has been tormenting all of us
for years, and I for one am sick of it.

264
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:14,404
I can't promise you victoy.
I can't promise you good times.

265
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,833
But the one thing I do know--
Whoa, whoa!

266
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:21,128
All right! Okay! I promise you
victoy! I promise you good times!

267
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,619
I got a " B"
in arithmetic

268
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:29,616
I got a " B"
in arithmetic

269
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:31,614
Would've got an "A"
but I was sick

270
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,611
Would've got an "A"
but I was sick

271
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,606
Aah!

272
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,596
We are rubber
you are glue

273
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,594
We are rubber
you are glue

274
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,558
It bounces off of us
and sticks to you

275
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:50,688
It bounces off of us
and sticks to you

276
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:52,686
- Sound off
- One, two

277
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,683
- Sound off
- Three, four

278
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,620
- Go!

279
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:19,050
- Go!

280
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,113
- What's the matter with you, soldier?
- It's my nerves, sir.

281
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:24,343
I just can't stand
the barking anymore.

282
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:28,338
Your nerves?
I won't have cowards in my army.

283
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,335
- Ow!
- Sory, Bart.

284
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,632
you can push them
out of a plane,

285
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,829
you can march them
off a cliff,

286
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,790
you can send 'em off to die
on some godforsaken rock,

287
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,286
but for some reason,
youcan't slap 'em.

288
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:44,283
Now apologize to
that boy right now.

289
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,180
- Sorry, man.
- It's cool.

290
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,777
In English class
I did the best

291
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:50,974
In English class
I did the best

292
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,971
Because I cheated
on the test

293
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:54,968
Because I cheated
on the test

294
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:56,966
- Sound off
- One, two

295
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,963
- I can't hear you!
- Three, four

296
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,692
All right, there's your enemy.
Now hit him!

297
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,657
Hithim!

298
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,486
Let's go, next group.
Martinez! Steinberg!

299
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:09,249
O'Hara! Chang!
Olajuwon! Herman!

300
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:15,141
Die! Die!

301
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,138
We are happy
We are merry

302
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:19,436
We are happy
We are merry

303
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,433
We got a rhyming
dictionary

304
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,530
We got a rhyming
dictionary

305
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,528
- Sound off
- One, two

306
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,624
- One more time!
- Three, four

307
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:29,622
Bring it
on home now!

308
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:32,418
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four

309
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,612
Nelson's at
the Elm Street Video Arcade.

310
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:40,108
Intelligence indicates he shakes down
kids for quarters at the arcade.

311
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,405
Then he heads to the Quick-E-Mart
for a cherry Squishy.

312
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:44,402
Then that's where
we'll hit him.

313
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:47,564
When he leaves the Quick-E-Mart,
we start the saturation bombing.

314
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:50,294
- We got the water balloons?
- Two hundred rounds, sir.

315
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:52,391
Is it okay if they say
" Happy Birthday" on the side?

316
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:56,985
Well, I'd rather they say " Death
From Above," but I guess we're stuck.

317
00:17:57,052 --> 00:18:00,547
Okay, our main force will
be split into two groups.

318
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,843
One will circle around this way
to cut off the enemy's retreat,

319
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:08,270
the other will drive in this way,
closing the trap.

320
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,364
- It's a classic pincers movement.
It can't fail against a ten-year-old.
- Heh-heh!

321
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,861
- Nelson's at the arcade, General.
- Battle stations.

322
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,424
- I feel so alive!
- you know,

323
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:19,421
I thought
I was too old.

324
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:21,918
I thought
my time had passed.

325
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:25,547
I thought I'd never hear
the screams of pain...

326
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:28,643
or see the look of terror
in a young man's eyes.

327
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,640
Thank heaven
for children.

328
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,637
Hey, good Squishies.

329
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,635
- What flavor did you get?
- Blue.

330
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,632
Hey, yout wo birds!

331
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:40,127
You're gonna be suckin' all
your meals through straws if
you don't shut your traps.

332
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,690
Well, looky here.

333
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,420
Little Bart Simpson.

334
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:48,083
Nelson, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to teach youa lesson.

335
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:50,414
Ha! Oh, yeah?
youand what army?

336
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,477
This one.

337
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:54,974
Artillery,

338
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:57,271
commence
saturation bombing!

339
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,943
Hey!

340
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,570
All right, you kids!
Keep it down!

341
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:24,568
Am I making myself--

342
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:26,997
Heh-heh-heh!
Got him!

343
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,993
You, up in the tree.
The tall gray-haired kid.

344
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,989
Get your butt down here
right now! Doh!

345
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:36,784
No! Please!

346
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,015
- Don't hurt us!
- Oh, we surrender.

347
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:41,411
W-W-We were only
followin' orders!

348
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,860
Eww!
Knock it off!

349
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,987
I guess you learned your lesson,
so now I'll untie you.

350
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:04,481
The second you untie me,
I'm gonna beat you to death, man.

351
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,643
Well, if that's gonna be your attitude,
I'm not gonna untie you.

352
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:10,639
Ha! You're gonna
have to sometime.

353
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,067
Uh-oh.
He's right.

354
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:18,362
Don't you wory.
I was ready for this little eventuality.

355
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,556
Armistice treaty,
article four.

356
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:27,150
" Nelson is never again to raise
his fists in anger." Article five.

357
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:30,712
" Nelson recognizes Bart's right
to exist." Article six.

358
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:34,007
"Although Nelson shall have
no official power,

359
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:36,804
he shall remain a figurehead
of menace in the neighborhood."

360
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,434
Wow. Sounds good to me.
Okay, I'll sign.

361
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,997
- What about you, boy?
- All right, I'll sign.

362
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:45,492
- Are you boys through playing war?
- Yes, Mrs. Simpson.

363
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:48,921
- Good. Then here's some cupcakes.
- Oh, boy!

364
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:51,284
- Cupcakes.
- Mmm!

365
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,509
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

366
00:20:57,576 --> 00:20:59,573
contray to what
you've just seen,

367
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:02,070
war is neither
glamorous nor fun.

368
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,999
There are no winners.
Only losers.

369
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:08,361
There are no good wars,
with the following exceptions:

370
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:11,457
The American Revolution, World War I,
and the Star Wars trilogy.

371
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:15,351
if you'd like to learn more
about war, there's lots of books
in your local libray--

372
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:17,349
many of them with
cool, goy pictures.

373
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:20,944
Well, good night, eveybody.
Peace, man.

374
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:29,019
- Shh!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
