2
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,128
Hey, kids!

3
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:38,230
Who do you love?

4
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:40,933
- Krusty!
- How much do you love me?

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,102
With all our hearts!

6
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,104
What would you do
if I went off the air?

7
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:46,806
We'd kill ourselves!

8
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,375
What's that, Sideshow Bob?

9
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,510
This is Brittany and today's
her birthday?

10
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,579
Well, happy birthday, Brittany!

11
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:58,017
How do you want to celebrate? Do you
want me to sing you a birthday song?

12
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:02,688
Or do you want me to shoot Sideshow Bob
out of a cannon?

13
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,790
The cannon. The cannon.

14
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,194
- The cannon. The cannon.
- The cannon.

15
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,296
Sorry, Sideshow Bob,

16
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,665
but it's her special birthday wish!

17
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:15,168
You're doomed, Sideshow Bob.

18
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,671
I know we haven't had much luck
shooting you out of this cannon,

19
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,474
but maybe that's because
we haven't used enough...

20
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,377
gunpowder!

21
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,681
Brittany, do the honors.

22
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,257
Don't blame me.

23
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,061
I didn't do it.

24
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,764
Comedy, thy name is Krusty.

25
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,635
Hey, kids, it's time
for Itchy and Scratchy!

26
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,272
They fight, they bite
They bite and fight and bite

27
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,274
Fight, fight, fight
Bite, bite, bite

28
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,944
The Itchy and Scratchy Show

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,157
Oh, my!
All this senseless violence.

30
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,227
- I don't understand its appeal.
- We don't expect you to, Mom.

31
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,031
If cartoons were meant for adults,
they'd put them on in prime time.

32
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,801
Y'ello.

33
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,937
Hello, Homie.
I was hoping you could pick up...

34
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,806
a half-gallon of premium ice cream
on your way home from work.

35
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,910
Ooh, premium--
Wait a minute. Why?

36
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,814
Patty and Selma are coming over
to show us slides from their trip
to the Yucatan.

37
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,816
Doh!

38
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,318
- Anybody home?
- Ooh, I've got to go, Homer.

39
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,187
My sisters are here.

40
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:46,193
Oh, eight carousels!
We're in for a real treat.

41
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,197
Hello, steady customer.
How are you this evening, sir?

42
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,199
How ya doin', Apu?

43
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,105
Mmm, chocolate.

44
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,107
Ooh, double chocolate.

45
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,277
New flavor-- triple chocolate!

46
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,780
Perhaps a little something
for the trip back to the cash register.

47
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,684
What's the matter, sir?

48
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:15,489
Never have I seen you look
so unhappy while purchasing
such a large quantity of ice cream.

49
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,358
The reason I look unhappy
is that tonight...

50
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,662
I have to see a slideshow
starring my wife's sisters.

51
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,165
Or as I call 'em, the Gruesome Twosome.

52
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,002
- Ow, my foot,
you lousy, stupid, clumsy--
- Sorry, pal.

53
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:34,174
Hand over all your money
in a paper bag.

54
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,744
Yes, yes. I know the procedure
for armed robbery.

55
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,146
I do work in a convenience store,
you know.

56
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,020
You can emerge now from my chips.

57
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:50,157
The opportunity to prove
yourself a hero is long gone.

58
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,259
- This is our tour group.
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:57,231
- This is a Mexican delicacy
called a taco platter.
- Mmm, delicious.

60
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:01,736
- This is Selma taking a siesta.
- "Ay, carumba!"

61
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:04,338
And he had a big nose.

62
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:08,109
No, bigger. And big red hair
that came out to--

63
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:12,613
- Yeah, yeah, like that!
- Well, it is a simple,
charcoal rendering, but, uh,

64
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:15,917
- is this the man?
- Yeah! wait a minute.

65
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,719
It's the guy from TV!

66
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,824
My kid's hero, Cruddy, Crummy--
Krusty the Clown!

67
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,202
Ahh.

68
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,714
Hey, hey, what's goin' on here?

69
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,217
Krusty the Clown,
you're under arrest for armed robbery.

70
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,719
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say--

71
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,089
- Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
- What is this, a joke?

72
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,494
- Ready, Mr. Simpson?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:02,297
Send in the clowns.

74
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,168
So, Simpson,
which one is it?

75
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:14,676
Well, if the crime is making me laugh,
they're all guilty!

76
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:18,747
- No, no! Which one is the robber?
- Oh, definitely number...

77
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,683
Simpson.

78
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:23,251
- Simpson!
- Four.

79
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:27,455
And this is all the mail
that awaited us upon our return.

80
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,891
And this is Selma...

81
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,562
dropping of four vacation film
to be developed.

82
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:37,666
Thus concludes
our Mexican odyssey.

83
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:40,969
Hmm. Very thorough.

84
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:43,538
I'm home, everybody!

85
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,974
-Oh, goody gumdrops.
-You missed the whole slide show, Homer.

86
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,777
Oh, fantastic. Marge, you're never
gonna believe what happened.

87
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:52,748
I was down at the Kwik-E-Mart
minding my own business when--
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the news!

88
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,419
Springfield's number one news team...

89
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,923
with our Emmy Award-winning
anchorman Kent Brockman,

90
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:04,226
Good evening, I'm Scott Christian.
Kent Brockman is off tonight.

91
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:08,363
Why did the clown cross the road?
To rob a Kwik-E-Mart.

92
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:12,434
The news story behind
that enigmatic half-joke
right after this commercial message.

93
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,736
Wait a minute. Bart, you know
that guy on your lunch box?

94
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,738
Oh, you mean,
Krusty the Clown?

95
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:19,208
- He's sort of a hero of yours,
isn't he?
- Are you kidding?

96
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,511
He's my idol. I've based
my whole life on Krusty's teachings.

97
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:26,015
- Uh, maybe you'd better run off to bed.
- Krusty the Clown is behind bars...

98
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:28,817
after a daring twilight
robbery of a local Kwik-E-Mart.

99
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:31,020
- Krusty!
- Oh, no!

100
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:35,724
Earlier this evening,
the Springfield SWAT team...

101
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:38,794
apprehended the TV clown,
who appears on a rival station...

102
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:41,096
opposite our own
Emmy Award-winning Hobo Hank.

103
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:44,700
And just in,
actual footage of the crime...

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,303
taken with the Kwik-E-Mart
security camera.

105
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:50,806
The reason I look unhappy
is that tonight I have to see...

106
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:53,676
a slide show starring
my wife's sisters.

107
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:55,878
Or as I call 'em, the Gruesome Twosome.

108
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:00,182
- Oh, Homer.
- So, the truth comes out.

109
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:05,287
- Hand over all your money
in a paper bag.
- Oh, Krusty, how could you?

110
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,758
I know it looks very bad, honey.
Who knows,

111
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:11,193
maybe it'll turn out
he was innocent all along.

112
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,397
Earth to Marge.
Earth to Marge.

113
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:18,067
I was there.
The clown is G-I-L-L-T-Y.

114
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:30,847
- You're my best friend.
- Thanks, Krusty.

115
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,550
Buy my cereal.

116
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,787
Buy my cereal.

117
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:40,556
I didn't do it!

118
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:44,060
Oh, I wish
I could believe you.

119
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,439
Good evening, again, Springfield.
Krusty the Clown,

120
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,142
the beloved idol
of countless tots,

121
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:01,644
now nothing more than
a common, alleged criminal.

122
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:06,249
His trial, which begins tomorrow,
has taken center ring
in a national media circus...

123
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:09,452
as children of all ages
from eight to 80...

124
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,223
hang on each new development
like so many Romanian trapeze artists.

125
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:16,226
From his humble beginnings
as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi,

126
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:19,129
Krusty clowned his way
to the top of a personal mini-empire...

127
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:22,899
with dozens of endorsements,
including his own line of pork products.

128
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,402
This may have led to one
of television's best-loved bloopers--

129
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:29,339
Krusty's near-fatal,
on-the-air heart attack in 1986.

130
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:33,109
Wasn't that a great Itchy
and Scratchy cartoon, kids?

131
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:35,912
Well, we've got
another one coming right up.

132
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:38,114
But first, I've got a hankerin'...

133
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:40,417
for some pork products.

134
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,986
Mmm. Look.

135
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,592
Plump succulent sausage, honey-smoked
bacon and glistening, sizzling--

136
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm dying. I'm dying.

137
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,272
But a quick triple bypass and
a pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back.

138
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:05,008
However,
he was a changed clown.

139
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:08,078
Where his show had been condemned
by parents and educators alike...

140
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:10,581
as simpleminded TV mayhem,

141
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,283
this new Krusty devoted
a small portion of every show...

142
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:16,954
to stamping out illiteracy
in today's anything-for-a-thrill youth.

143
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,956
Give a hoot.
Read a book.

144
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,359
Krusty's arrest has sent
shockwaves through Springfield,
packing its churches,

145
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:26,663
synagogues and mosques
with disillusioned citizeny
from all walks of life.

146
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:30,367
I urge every halfway
decent member of our community...

147
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:33,971
to gather up all merchandise
that bears the likeness of Krusty,

148
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:36,173
that clown prince
of corruption,

149
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,176
and join me
in a public burning!

150
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:42,546
So, is Krusty the Clown about
to trade in his baggy pants...

151
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,449
for the relatively snug uniform
of Springfield Penitentiary?

152
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:48,552
We'll find out tomorrow
when his trial begins.

153
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,127
- Uh, what kind of gun did you use?
- Did you use an accomplice?

154
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,129
Will you plead insanity?

155
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,765
Look at him.
His clothes are so drab.

156
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:03,434
His face
is so flesh-colored and sad.

157
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:07,038
And his feet,
they're so small.

158
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:09,907
Say it ain't so, Krusty.

159
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,843
My client has no comment at this time.

160
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:15,846
I didn't do it.

161
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,919
- Krusty the Clown, how do you plead?
- I plead guilty, Your Honor.

162
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:27,124
Oh.

163
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:30,228
I mean, not guilty.
Opening night jitters, Your Honor.

164
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:34,432
I would like to call to the stand,
Homer J.Simpson.

165
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:36,501
Don't do it, Dad.
Please don't do it.

166
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,203
Sorry, son.
You'll understand one day.

167
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:41,706
He's innocent, I tell you. Krusty
would never do something like that.

168
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:44,008
Oh, come on, Dad.
You got to listen to me.

169
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:49,380
Sorry, pal.

170
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,183
Doh!

171
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:54,185
Mr. Simpson, was that you
taking that cowardly dive...

172
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,588
into that display of
heavily-salted snack treats?

173
00:11:56,688 --> 00:12:00,892
- Yes, sir.
- Do you recognize the gunman
in this courtroom today?

174
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,895
- Yes, I do.
- Fine. Would you point him out to us?

175
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:06,598
Okay.

176
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,475
Aaah!

177
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:22,480
- Oh, man.
- Let the record show that
the witness... eventually...

178
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:25,550
pointed to...
Krusty the Clown.

179
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:31,556
These toys are just adorable.

180
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:36,561
Who'd have guessed they were inspired
by an insane criminal genius?

181
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:42,434
But, Dad, you're giving in
to mob mentality.

182
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:45,237
No, I'm not!
I'm hopping on the bandwagon.

183
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:47,739
Now, come on, son.
Get with the winning team.

184
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:52,944
Hey, right here! Krusty souvenirs!
Buy 'em and burn 'em!

185
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:55,213
Good people,

186
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:57,215
I'm so happy
you're all here tonight.

187
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:59,451
But please,
just a few words of caution.

188
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:03,221
Now, we are going to set
this pile of evil ablaze,

189
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:06,725
but because these are children's toys,
the fire will spread quickly.

190
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:11,730
So, please stand back,
and try not to inhale the toxic fumes.

191
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:18,103
Ooh!

192
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:24,610
Krusty, would you please turn
your attention to Exhibit B.

193
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,912
- Uh--
- Tell me what you see.

194
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:31,016
Uh, uh--
Which one do you mean?

195
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:33,318
The one with
the big "B" on it.

196
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:35,621
- Uh, uh, uh--
- What's the matter? Can't you read?

197
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:39,391
No, I can't! I can't read or write!
I admit it!

198
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:42,995
I'm totally illiterate.
Now are you happy?

199
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:46,765
Can it be that the champion of
child literacy can't even read himself?

200
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,767
Is it a crime
to be illiterate?

201
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:52,271
All right, all right.
See this, Krusty? This is a B.

202
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:54,273
And this is Exhibit B.

203
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:57,576
Betting slips-- obtained by this court
indicating you have lost...

204
00:13:57,576 --> 00:14:00,779
substantial sums of money
on sports gambling.

205
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,182
Is it a crime to bet
on sporting events?

206
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:05,785
- Yes, it is!
- Oh.

207
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:12,291
- Foreperson,
have you reached a verdict?
- Yes, we have, Your Honor.

208
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,161
We find the defendant,
Krusty the Clown...

209
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:20,166
guilty.

210
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,069
I knew it!
This happens to me every time.

211
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,943
My young friends,
for years I have been silent...

212
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:34,247
save for the crude glissandos
of this primitive wind instrument.

213
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,350
But now, destiny has thrust me
into the center ring.

214
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,254
In the coming weeks,
you will notice some rather
sweeping changes in our program.

215
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,256
Please do not be alarmed.

216
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:46,459
Itchy and Scratchy
will still have a home here.

217
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:49,729
But we will also learn about nutrition,
self-esteem, etiquette...

218
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,232
- And all the lively arts.
- What the hell are you doing, Lis?

219
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:57,737
I'm watching Sideshow Bob. He's a lot
less patronizing than Krusty used to be.

220
00:14:57,837 --> 00:15:01,240
- You backstabber, you traitor, you--
- Snap out of it, Bart!

221
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,112
Face the facts.
All those hours we spent staring
at Krusty, we were staring at a crook.

222
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,615
Look, Lisa.
I know Krusty's innocent.

223
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:11,050
Don't ask me why.
It's just a feeling I have.

224
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:13,319
- Oh, Bart.
- Come on, Lisa.

225
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:16,189
I think I can prove Krusty's innocent,
but I need your help.

226
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:19,692
- You do? Why?
- Oh, come on, Lis. You know why.

227
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:24,197
- No, why?
- I'll never forgive you
for making me say this.

228
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:27,000
You're smarter than me.

229
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,302
- So, you with me?
- Yeah, man.

230
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:34,908
Oh, oh. Okay, okay.

231
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:37,277
Don't try anything funny.
I'm armed to the teeth.

232
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,084
Bart, look,
over here on the microwave.

233
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,219
So, I don't
have a pacemaker.

234
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:49,890
Come on, Bart. The tape showed
that the robber heated up a burrito.

235
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,293
- So?
- Don't you remember
the get-well card we sent to Krusty?

236
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,362
It was after his heart attack...

237
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:58,365
- when he had a pacemaker put in.
- Aha!

238
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,969
Wait a minute.
Krusty can't read.

239
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:06,173
Okay! Okay!
So the poor guy can't read.
Can't we get off his back, already?

240
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,475
No! Don't you get it, Bart?

241
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:12,379
How could Krusty have been reading
a magazine if he can't read?

242
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:15,048
Hey, hey.
This is not a lending library!

243
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,452
If you're not going to
buy that thing put it down,
or I'll blow your heads off!

244
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:21,755
Bart, I'm starting to think
you're right. Krusty was framed!

245
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,824
- Did he have any enemies?
- I don't know.

246
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:28,162
But I know someone who would--
Krusty's best friend
in the whole world, Sideshow Bob!

247
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:32,266
"A volley of muskety
flamed, thundered, roared."

248
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:34,835
A profound silence followed,

249
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:37,037
broken only
by the approaching footsteps...

250
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,940
"- of the Third Brigade."

251
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,145
Next week, chapter 35 of The Man in
the Iron Mask: "The Death of a Titan."

252
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,717
Well, kids,
that's our show for today.

253
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,853
And now, in the words
of Mr. Cole Porter.

254
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,924
Evey time we say good-bye

255
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:59,226
I die a little

256
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:02,997
Evey time we say good-bye

257
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,733
I wonder why a little

258
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,736
Evey time we say

259
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:12,606
Good-bye
Good-bye.

260
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:17,445
Great show, Sideshow. Switchboards
were jammed. The kids loved it.

261
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,580
Thanks, Ed. I glad we've
finally dispelled the myth...

262
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:22,383
that I'm too uptown
for the tots.

263
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:25,219
And yet, I can't help thinking
about poor Krusty.

264
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,470
- We see your face on key chains.
- And water-action pens.

265
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,106
- And snow domes.
- This is all very exciting,

266
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,109
but I think we'd do well to explore
the more upscale market.

267
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:52,180
For instance,
Sideshow Bob limited-edition prints,
collector's plates,

268
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,549
- commemorative coins.
- Ah.

269
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:58,186
Some kids are here to see you,
Sideshow Bob. They say it's important.

270
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:00,555
Ah, well, we can sign
these contracts tomorrow.

271
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:04,258
Certainly. I take great pride
in being able to sign my own name.

272
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,262
That's a good one.
I gotta tell the wife.

273
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:09,364
- Hi, Sideshow Bob.
- Sideshow Bob, can we ask you a few--

274
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:13,268
Forgive me.
As much as Sideshow Bob would love
to chat, he has a show starting.

275
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,270
Here you go-- three tickets.
Be my guests.

276
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:17,772
- Uh, okay. But--
- Come, come. Let's run along.

277
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:24,946
Hello, children.

278
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,716
- Whom do you love?
- Sideshow Bob!

279
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,719
Come on, Bart.
Go with the flow.

280
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:34,656
- How much do you love me?
- With all our hearts!

281
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:37,158
About a zillionth
as much as I love Krusty.

282
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:40,528
Today's show promises to be a marvelous
celebration of the human spirit.

283
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,531
But first, I regret to say
I see a youngster who looks troubled.

284
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:46,735
- What's your name, young man?
- Bart Simpson, sir.

285
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:49,437
Hmm. Well, perhaps we can
shed some light...

286
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:52,941
on your problem in a new segment
exploring preadolescent turmoil.

287
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:56,011
- I call it "Choices."
- I don't think so, sir.

288
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:59,014
Bart, I'm reaching out to you.

289
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:03,318
So, what's on your mind, Bart?

290
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:05,887
- I bet the other children
don't accept you.
- True, Sideshow Bob.

291
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,390
But that doesn't bother me.
You see, my sisters and I...

292
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,625
have been doing
a little investigating,

293
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,894
and it looks to us
like Krusty was framed.

294
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,031
- Framed?
- Well, the videotape showed...

295
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,400
that the thief used the microwave oven
at the Kwik-E-Mart.

296
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,703
But Krusty couldn't go near the thing,
not with his pacemaker.

297
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:24,973
Well, you know, Bart.
As much as I love Krusty,

298
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,609
he was never one to take
doctor's orders too seriously.

299
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,779
Well, maybe, but get this.

300
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:32,981
Krusty was illiterate,
and the guy who robbed the store...

301
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,983
was reading
the Springfield Review of Books.

302
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:37,085
Ah, well, Bart.

303
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:41,190
The fact is, you don't have
to be able to read to enjoy
the Springfield Review of Books.

304
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,059
Just look at these amusing caricatures
of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag.

305
00:19:44,193 --> 00:19:47,696
Yeah, I guess those are kind of funny.

306
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:51,800
Bart, children, this whole sordid affair
has been a shock to all of us.

307
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,169
But we must get on
with our lives.

308
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:57,273
Let's try to remember Krusty,
not as a hardened criminal,

309
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:00,943
but as that lovable jester
who honked his horn and
puttered around in his little car.

310
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:04,079
- And shot you out of a cannon.
- And shot me out of a cannon.

311
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:06,148
Yes, we will never
forget that, will we?

312
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:10,452
Bart, open you heart. I admit
I have some mighty big shoes to fill.

313
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,756
Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill.

314
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:16,859
Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill.

315
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:21,163
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.

316
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,165
Big shoes to fill--

317
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:27,036
In ancient Greece, there was
a school of thought called stoicism.

318
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:30,039
Wait a minute! You did it!

319
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:33,042
- Excuse me?
- Attention, fellow children!

320
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:36,746
Krusty didn't rob that store! Sideshow
Bob framed him, and I got proof!

321
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:40,550
Ow! My foot!
You lousy, stupid, clumsy--

322
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:44,253
- See that? Krusty wore
big floppy shoes,

323
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,756
but he's got little feet
like all good-hearted people!

324
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:51,327
Sideshow Bob really fills
his shoes with big ugly feet.

325
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:54,931
- Kid's right.
- How do you figure we missed that?

326
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:57,834
Get off your duffs, boys.
Get down to that studio!

327
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:01,704
Yes, I admit it.
I hated him!

328
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:05,208
His hackneyed shenanigans
robbed me of my dignity for years.

329
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:09,012
I played the buffoon while he squandered
a fortune on his vulgar appetites.

330
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:11,514
That's why I framed Krusty!

331
00:21:11,614 --> 00:21:14,784
And I would have gotten away with it too
if it weren't for these meddling kids.

332
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:18,721
- Take him away, boys.
- Treat kids as equals!

333
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:21,491
They're people too!
They're smarter than you think.

334
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:24,294
They were smart enough
to catch me!

335
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:31,801
Well, we... made...

336
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:34,170
a terrible, terrible mistake.

337
00:21:34,304 --> 00:21:36,573
Uh, it won't happen again.

338
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:39,075
- It better not, you dimwit!
- Krusty,

339
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:43,079
I'm man enough to admit I was wrong,
and I'm sorry I fingered you in court.

340
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,281
I sincerely hope that
the horrible stories I heard...

341
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:47,684
about what goes on
in prison are exaggerated.

342
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:51,087
Well, the important thing is that
I regain the trust of the children.

343
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:54,758
But there was one boy
who trusted me all along. Bart?

344
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:57,160
- Yes, sir?
- Thank you.

345
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:02,593
Shh.
