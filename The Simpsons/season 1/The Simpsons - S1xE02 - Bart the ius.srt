1
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,059
Come on, Mom.

2
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,061
Yeah, Mom.
Hurry up.

3
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,732
All right. Mmm.
How about "he"?

4
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:50,152
Two points.
Your turn, dear.

5
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:55,324
Hmm. How could anyone make a word
out of these lousy letters?

6
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,035
Oh, wait.
Here's a good one." Do."

7
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,329
"Id."
Triple word score.

8
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,957
- Hey, no abbreviations.
- Not I.D., Dad."Id." It's a word.

9
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,628
- As in,"This game is stup-id."
- Hey, shut up, boy.

10
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,547
Yeah, Bart. You're supposed to be
developing verbal abilities...

11
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,133
for your big aptitude test
tomorrow.

12
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,761
We could look this "id" thing
up in the dictionary.

13
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,723
- We got one?
- I think it's under
the short leg of the couch.

14
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,437
"Id: Along with the ego
and the superego...

15
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,523
one of three components
of the psyche."

16
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:31,151
- Get outta here.
- My turn." Kwyjibo."

17
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,447
K-W-Y-J-I-B-O.

18
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,741
Twenty-two points,
plus triple word score...

19
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,035
plus 50 points for using
all my letters.

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,455
- Game's over. I'm outta here.
- Wait a minute, you little cheater.

21
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,042
You're not going anywhere
until you tell me what a "kwyjibo" is.

22
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,461
" Kwyjibo." Uh--

23
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,423
A big, dumb, balding,
North American ape with no chin.

24
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,760
- And a short temper.
- I'll show you a big,
dumb, balding ape!

25
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,137
Uh-oh.
Kwyjibo on the loose.

26
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,559
We come from Springfield
and we sell swampland

27
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,942
you there. No chewing gum on school
grounds. In the trashcan with it.

28
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,529
Principal Skinner...

29
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,656
one of my fellow children
is vandalizing school property.

30
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,658
Oh? Where?

31
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,160
Over there, sir.
See?

32
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,746
- Look out, Bart. Here comes Skinner.
- Yikes!

33
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,542
Hmm.

34
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,462
- Whoever did this
is in very deep trouble.

35
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,423
And a sloppy speller too.

36
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,427
The preferred spelling
of"wiener" is w-i-e-n-e-r...

37
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,847
although "e-i"
is an acceptable ethnic variant.

38
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,641
Good point.
Boys, let's see your hands.

39
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,643
Mm-hmm.

40
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,855
Good. Okay.
Simpson?

41
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,650
you might say you
caught him red-handed.

42
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,945
Simpson, you and I
are going to have a little talk.

43
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,947
Same time, same place?

44
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,325
Yes. In my office
after school.

45
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,243
Ooh!

46
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:11,043
Bart, I hope you won't bear some sort
of simpleminded grudge against me.

47
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,046
I was merely tying to fend off
the desecration of the school building.

48
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,048
- Eat my shorts.
- Pardon?

49
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,133
Now, I don't want you
to wory, class.

50
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,344
These tests will have
no effect on your grades.

51
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,348
They merely determine your future social
status and financial success. If any.

52
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,226
Mrs. Krabappel, isn't Bart
supposed to face the window...

53
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,645
so he won't be tempted to look
at his neighbor's paper?

54
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,856
- You're right, Martin. Bart?

55
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,236
Remember to visualize
the complex problems, and relax.

56
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,739
The test will start... now!

57
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,624
"At 7:30 a. m., an express train
traveling 60 miles an hour...

58
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,044
leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix,
520 miles away."

59
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,463
Shh!
Visualizeit, Bart.

60
00:04:56,547 --> 00:05:00,551
"At the same time, a local train
traveling 30 miles an hour...

61
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,429
and carrying 40 passengers
leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe.

62
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:09,935
It's eight cars long and
always carries the same number
of passengers in each car.

63
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,937
An hour later,
a number of passengers...

64
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,440
equal to half the number of minutes
past the hour get off...

65
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,235
but three times as many
plus six get on.

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,655
At the second stop,
half the passengers plus two get off...

67
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,157
but twice as many
get on as got on at the first stop."

68
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,159
Oof!.

69
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,247
- Ticket, please.
- I don't have a ticket.

70
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,250
Come with me, boy.

71
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,045
- We've got a stowaway, sir.
- I'll pay. How much?

72
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,132
Twice the fare
from Tucson to Flagstaff...

73
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:44,136
minus two-thirds of the fare from
Albuquerque to El Paso.

74
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,348
- Whoa!

75
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,441
Bart, there are students
in this class with a chance to do well.

76
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,443
Will you stop
bothering them?

77
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,737
He's not bothering me,
Mrs. Krabappel. I'm finished.

78
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,739
May I go outside
and read under a tree?

79
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,158
Certainly, Martin.

80
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,836
What are you
looking at, Bart?

81
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,839
Are those naughty dogs
back again?

82
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,057
you have 20 minutes, class.

83
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,233
He's a good boy now,
and he's getting better...

84
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,735
and sometimes even the best sheep
stray from the flock...

85
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,737
and need to be hugged
extra hard.

86
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,823
That's exactly the kind of crapola
that's lousing him up.

87
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,744
Hey, look at this.
"I am a wiener."

88
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,247
He sure is.

89
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,249
- Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are here.

90
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,251
Send them in.

91
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,462
- Hello again.
- What have you done this time, boy?

92
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,549
I caught your son
defacing school property this morning.

93
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,760
We estimate the damage
at $75, and frankly...

94
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:10,138
we think it's terribly unfair that
other taxpayers should foot the bill.

95
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,432
Yeah, it's a crummy system,
but what are you gonna do?

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,436
Oh, no.
He can't mean that.

97
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,856
My wife thinks
you want me to pay for it.

98
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,441
- That was the idea.
- Oh.

99
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:25,445
By itself, something like this might
not call for an extreme penalty...

100
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,739
but this is not
an isolated incident.

101
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,659
Bart's behavior is unruly.

102
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,830
He's frequently absent
from school, then gives teachers
pathetic excusenotes...

103
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,542
that are obviously childish forgeries
when compared to--

104
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,340
Well, at any rate,
it is my reluctant decision--

105
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,634
- Mr. Skinner, Dr. Pyor
is here to see you.

106
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,845
- He says it's urgent.
- Send him in.

107
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:55,058
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,
this is our district psychiatrist,
Dr. J.Loren Pryor.

108
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,228
What do we need a psychiatrist for?
We know our kid is nuts.

109
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,940
Oh, on the contray. I have some
vey exciting news for all of us.

110
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,026
This aptitude test
we administered this morning...

111
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,446
has revealed that the young Bart here
is what we call a "gifted child."

112
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,948
- A what?
- Your son is a genius, Mr. Simpson.

113
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,950
- Bart?
- This lunkhead?
- Impossible.

114
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,952
No, no,
we're quite certain.

115
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,954
The child is not supposed
to know his own IQ, of course...

116
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,665
but, uh, you can see
it's beyond the range of any doubt.

117
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:23,253
- 912!
- Uh, no, you have it
upside down. It's 216.

118
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,048
- Oh.
- That's still amazingly high.

119
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,551
Tell me, Bart,
are you ever bored in school?

120
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,553
- Oh, you bet.
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,555
Ever feel a little frustrated?

122
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,766
- All the time, sir.
- Uh-huh.

123
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,726
Do you ever dream
of leaving your class...

124
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,729
to pursue your own intellectual
development on an independent basis?

125
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,149
- Wow! It's like you're
reading my mind, man.
- Uh-huh.

126
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,151
you see, when a child
with Bart's intellect...

127
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,737
is forced to slow down
to the pace of a normal person...

128
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,533
he's probably going to lash out
in ways like these.

129
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,535
I think we should retest him.

130
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,663
- We should move him to another school.
- Ooh. Better yet.

131
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,748
Bart, we'd like you
to try a kind of school...

132
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:04,545
that doesn't rely on grades and rules
and bells and buzzers.

133
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,547
A school without walls...

134
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,842
where you do as much or as little of
the assignments as you feel you need to.

135
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,344
- Does that sound good, Bart?
- Sign me up, Doc.

136
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,556
Excellent. We're all set.
Here's all the information you need.

137
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,641
Show up around nine-ish.

138
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,644
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,
congratulations once again.

139
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,729
I think we're all
in a mood to celebrate.

140
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:27,025
Doc, this is all too much. I mean,
my son a genius? How does it happen?

141
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,531
Genius-level intelligence is usually
the result of heredity and environment.

142
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:37,327
Although, in some cases,
it's a total mystery.

143
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,165
Aw, come on, Mom.

144
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,126
you look vey
intelligent, dear.

145
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,128
No way!

146
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,466
How about a tie, son? Eveybody knows
boy geniuses wear ties.

147
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,635
You're stifling
my creativity, Dad.

148
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,138
- Sorry, boy.
- Bart, this is a big day for you.

149
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,432
Why don't you eat something
a little more nutritious?

150
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:02,728
Nonsense, Marge. Frosty Krusty Flakes
are what got him where he is today.

151
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:06,356
It could be one of these chemicals here
that makes him so smart.

152
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,234
Lisa, maybe you should
try some of this.

153
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,946
- Homer!
- I'm just saying why not have
two geniuses in the family?

154
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,657
Sort of a spare in case
Bart's brain blows up.

155
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,952
I don't care what that stupid
test says, Bart. You're a dimwit.

156
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,954
Maybe so,
but from now on...

157
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,040
this dimwit
is on easy street.

158
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,461
- No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route.
- Gotcha.

159
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,055
Oh, no. Ties.

160
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,265
Don't worry, son.
you can have mine.

161
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,851
Here. Let me show you
how to put on a tie.

162
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,729
The hook goes over the top
and these things go in there.

163
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,148
Thanks, Dad.

164
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,027
you kissed me.

165
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:56,532
There's nothing wrong with a father
kissing his son. I think.

166
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,159
Now go on, boy,
and pay attention.

167
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,037
Because if you do, one day
you may achieve something...

168
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,249
that we Simpsons
have dreamed about for generations.

169
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,543
you may outsmart someone.

170
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,965
You must be Bart Simpson.

171
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,426
I'm Ms. Melon,
your learning coordinator.

172
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,555
Let me say right at the start
that we have one rule here:

173
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,557
Make your own rules.

174
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,142
If you feel sleepy,
take a nap.

175
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,437
If you get bored, feel free
to take out a book and start reading.

176
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,065
- What should I read, ma'am?
- Anything you want, Bart.

177
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,736
Oh!

178
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,738
A comic book?

179
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,032
How did this
get mixed in here?

180
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:43,662
We used it last week as a prop
in a film we made about illiteracy.

181
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,747
Bart, these are the students
who will share your work area.

182
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,749
This is Ethan Foley.

183
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,336
O Memsahib, Bart.
Rabbi has memo.

184
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,756
- What?
- Ethan's very good with palindromes.

185
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,759
you know, sentences spelled
the same backwards and forwards.

186
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,761
And this is Sidney Swift.

187
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,848
- Trabing norm doog.
- What's your problem?

188
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,766
Oh, don't mind Sidney.

189
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,352
He's just speaking
in backwards phonetics today.

190
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,438
He said,
"Good morning, Bart."

191
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,357
- And this is Cecile Shapiro.
- Hi, Bart.

192
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,234
Cool hamsters.
What are their names?

193
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,738
Hamster Number One has been infected
with a staphylococci virus.

194
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,157
Hamster NumberTwo
is the control hamster.

195
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,159
Hi, little control hamster.

196
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,829
I wouldn't get too attached.
We're dissecting him next week.

197
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,831
Discover your desks, people.

198
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,334
Now let's all welcome
the newest member...

199
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,128
of our collective experience,
Bart Simpson.

200
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,466
And now we can continue
our debate from yesterday.

201
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,760
When we left off,
Calvin and Tanya were arguing...

202
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,762
that free will
is an illusion.

203
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,640
If you ask me,
humankind has freedom...

204
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,434
a freedom fraught
with paradoxes.

205
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,728
Freud shows how childhood
shapes our subconscious mind...

206
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,064
but this helps us
to think for ourselves.

207
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,066
Very good, Ian.

208
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:58,445
Does anyone else
have an example of a paradox?

209
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,657
Without law and order,
man has no freedom.

210
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,451
If you want peace,
you must prepare for war.

211
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,453
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

212
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,539
Well, it seems
the smartest child in the class...

213
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,666
is also the quietest.

214
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,960
Bart, what other paradoxes
affect our lives?

215
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,466
Well... you're
damned if you do...

216
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,635
and you're damned
if you don't.

217
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,055
Well, I guess that
would be a paradox too.

218
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,140
Thank you, Bart.

219
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,351
Whew!

220
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,731
Tell you what, Bart. I'll trade you
the weight of a bowling ball...

221
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,942
on the eighth moon
of Jupiter from my lunch...

222
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,946
for the weight of a feather on the
second moon of Neptune from your lunch.

223
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,740
- Well, okay.
- There you go!

224
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,454
I'll trade you1,000 picoliters
of my milk for 4 gills of yours.

225
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,749
- Well, all right.
- Anything you say.

226
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,838
Uh, Bart, would you wager
your cupcake against my--

227
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,840
Save your breath.

228
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,050
What do you think
of the new kid?

229
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,052
A rather mediocre genius.

230
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:07,055
Yes, not vey bright at all.

231
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,937
- So, how was it?

232
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,355
- Os-os.
- What?

233
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,442
- That's backwards for so-so.
- Wow.

234
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,861
What are you reading there?
Comic books?

235
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,864
Uh, guess you don't want
to overheat the old noggin, eh?

236
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,866
Tell you what.

237
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,868
To celebrate your first day
of genius school...

238
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,662
what do you say we go out for a round
off rosty chocolate milkshakes?

239
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,664
All righty!

240
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:36,668
Bart, I feel so bad for going
so many years without...

241
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,629
mmm, hmm--

242
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,840
What's that word where you
encourage something to grow?

243
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,137
- Nurturing.
- Nurturing your brilliant brain...

244
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,431
so I got tickets
to the opera tonight.

245
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,558
Hurry up. Get dressed.
It starts at 8:00.

246
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,644
Oh, Mom.
Not tonight.

247
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,647
Bart, your mother's only tying to help,
so go ahead and enjoy the show.

248
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,360
- Homer, you're going too.
- But I'm not a genius.
Why should I suffer?

249
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,865
Hey, Lis, keep an eye out
for the guy with the peanuts.

250
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,243
There's no guy
with peanuts, dear.

251
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:12,746
- Geez. No beer. No opera dogs.
- Shh!

252
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,966
Toreador, oh,
don't spit on the floor

253
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:28,136
Please use the cuspidor
That's what it's for

254
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,931
- Bart, stop fooling around.

255
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,933
Homer, stop encouraging him.

256
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,935
Don't stifle the boy, Marge.

257
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,729
- We're supposed to encourage him.
- Shush!

258
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,544
Shh!

259
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,845
- Who's the lard butt?
-He's the bullfighter.

260
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,264
No way a bull's gonna miss
a target that big, man.

261
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,529
Who are those people?

262
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:31,241
P.U.When is this over?

263
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,243
It ain't over
till the fat lady sings.

264
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,245
Is that one fat enough
for you, son?

265
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,460
Let's go get a burger.

266
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,463
So,"Y" equals
" R" cubed over three.

267
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:47,758
And if you determine the rate of change
in this curve correctly...

268
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,470
I think you will be
pleasantly surprised.

269
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:59,061
Don't you get it, Bart?
Derivative D-Y equals three R squared...

270
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:04,942
D R over three, or R squared D R,
or R D R R.

271
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,444
Har-dee-har-har.
Get it?

272
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,739
Oh, yeah.

273
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,747
Hi, guys.
Great to see ya.

274
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,042
- Get lost, Poindexter.
- Yeah, beat it, Professor.

275
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,837
Why don't you go build
a rocket ship, brainiac?

276
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:31,260
Well, come on, you two.
Don't forget about the film festival.

277
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,846
- The what?
- Oh, sorry, Bart.

278
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,849
Your mother bought us tickets
to a snooty movie...

279
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,851
directed by
some Swedish meatball.

280
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:42,145
Oh, no.

281
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,731
Well, I guess we don't
have to do that.

282
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:49,069
Um, look, Dad.
I got something to tell you.

283
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,363
Can it wait, son?
It's getting kinda dark.

284
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,449
All right, Homer.
Come on, baby.

285
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,952
- Right across the plate.
Let me feel the wind.

286
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,038
Whoa! Strike two!
Two and two.

287
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,541
Can you still
see the ball, Bart?

288
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,460
Don't worry, Home boy.
You're not that fast.

289
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,462
Oh, you don't
think so, eh?

290
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:11,049
Well, here comes
some real heat.

291
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,344
Whoa! Yeah, strike three!
You're outta there!

292
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:18,056
- So, what was it you
wanted to tell me, son?
- Oh, nothing, Pop.

293
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,852
I'm still trying
to get you a labpartner, Bart.

294
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,063
If we don't get any volunteers soon,
I'll assign somebody.

295
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,441
Say, what's that?
It looks dangerous.

296
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:31,236
Well, it's really pretty
top secret, ma'am.

297
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,238
All right, keep going.

298
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,450
But you do know what happens
when you mix acids and bases, right?

299
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,535
- 'Course I do.

300
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,167
- Sorry.

301
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:49,755
Now, Bart, we want to emphasize
that nobody's angry about this.

302
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,840
We're--
We're just concerned.

303
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,969
When a young man with a 216 IQ
can't make a simple experiment work...

304
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,431
well, it doesn't take a Bart Simpson
to figure out that something's wrong.

305
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,434
Tell me. Is the class
moving too slowly for you?

306
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,562
- Lord, no.
- Well, then, what can
we do to make you happy?

307
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,564
I wanna go back
to my old class.

308
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,650
Oh, but, Bart,
don't you remember the boredom...

309
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,945
the ennui,
the intellectual malaise?

310
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,030
Yeah, well, you know,
kinda, um...

311
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,449
but I was thinking
I could go undercover.

312
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:21,245
Undercover?
Bart, I'm intrigued. Go on.

313
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,665
Well, I could pretend
I'm a regular dumb kid.

314
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,960
you know, to study them and all
the stuff they do with each other.

315
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,962
you know, see what
makes them tick.

316
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,464
I see. Like Jane Goodall
and the chimps.

317
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,467
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. This is most impressive, Bart.

318
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,470
you write up your proposal
while I talk to Principal Skinner.

319
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,931
- Proposal?
- you know, outline your project...

320
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:44,059
what you hope to achieve,
what you'll require to do it.

321
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,144
Gotcha, man.

322
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:51,066
"'My proposal' by Bart Simpson.

323
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,069
I want to pretend...

324
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:58,156
I am a regular dumb kid.
Period.

325
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:02,035
By this, I hope--"

326
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,457
Oh, no.
" For this, I will--"

327
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,962
Ohh." Require--"

328
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:16,633
Ohh. Oh, man.

329
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,637
"'My Confession'

330
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:24,433
I am a regular
dumb kid. Period.

331
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,645
I cheated on
my intelligence test. Period."

332
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,731
Ah, finished already?

333
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:34,443
Principal Skinner will be
vey interested to-- to--

334
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,946
Oh. You know...

335
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,532
you misspelled "confession."

336
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,534
Hey, lookin' good, Bart.

337
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,538
- Bart, what happened?
- I had a little accident
in chemisty today.

338
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:51,460
Well, I bet it's nothing a little
turpentine won't take off. Come on, son.

339
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,546
Don't be discouraged, son.

340
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,548
I bet Einstein turned himself
all sorts of colors...

341
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,967
before he invented
the lightbulb.

342
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,345
Dad, I gotta tell you something.

343
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,263
Hope you won't be too mad.

344
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,850
- What is it, son?
- I'm not a genius, Dad.

345
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,146
- What?
- I cheated on the intelligence test.

346
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,149
I'm sorry. Butl
just want to say...

347
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,652
that the past few weeks
have been great.

348
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,862
Me and you have
done stuff together.

349
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,864
You've helped me out
with things...

350
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,242
and we're closer
than we've ever been.

351
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,369
I love you, Dad.

352
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:29,540
And I think if something
can bring us that close...

353
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,834
it can't possibly be bad.

354
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:35,963
- Why, you little--
- Uh-oh.

355
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,758
- What's going on out there?

356
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,844
I think Bart's
stupid again, Mom.

357
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,846
Oh, well.

358
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,058
you can't stay
in there forever!

359
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,937
- I can ty.
- March your butt right out here, now!

360
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:56,567
- No way, man.
- But-- Son, if you don't come out...

361
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,654
I can't hug you and kiss you
and make you feel all better.

362
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,241
you think I'm dumb enough
to fall for that? I'm insulted.

363
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,048
Shh!
