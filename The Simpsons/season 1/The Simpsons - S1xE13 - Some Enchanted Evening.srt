1
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:36,972
Now to our own pie in the sky--
Bill Pie in the KBBL trafficcopter.

2
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,391
- So come in, Bill.
- Bad news, drivers.

3
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,561
There's an overturned melon truck
on the interstate. Oh, it's a mess.

4
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,772
There's lots of rubber neck in gandmelon
wrestling going on, so expect delays--

5
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,568
- Hey, doughnuts!
- Bart, there's one left, and it's mine.

6
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,200
Oh!

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,784
- Aw, Homer!
- Aw, Dad!

8
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,579
- Uh-oh, schoolbus!

9
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,998
Cool your jets, man. We're comin'.

10
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,292
You forgot the special lunches I made.

11
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,794
- That's okay, Mom!
- We got money!

12
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,173
- Now, just a darn--
- Aah!

13
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,383
Mmm.

14
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,889
Oh.

15
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:23,185
- This is Bill Pie, your pie
in the sky, saying good-bye.
-KBBL

16
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,897
Well, Maggie,
it's just you and me again.

17
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,070
This is KBBL,
K-Babble, all talk, 24 hours a day.

18
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,989
If you'd like to share your
embarrassing problem with our audience,

19
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,368
we invite you to call our therapist
of the airwaves, Dr. Marvin Monroe.

20
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,664
Our number is 555-PAI N.

21
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,166
Don't be afraid. Call now.

22
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:54,091
- Hello.
I'd like to talk to Dr. Monroe.
- First name, age, problem?

23
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:58,595
I'm Marge, 34,
and my problem is my husband.

24
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,765
He doesn't listen to me.
He doesn't appreciate me.

25
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,892
I don't know how much more
of this I can--

26
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,687
Save your whining for when
you're on the air, okay?

27
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,277
Okay, let's see.
Next we have Marge.

28
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,280
She's 34 and trapped in
a loveless sham of a marriage.

29
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,700
Hey, turn it up.
I love hearing those wackos.

30
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,078
- Tell me 'bout your husband, Marge.
- Well--

31
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,873
When we were dating,
he was sweeter...

32
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,667
and more romantic and 40 pounds thinner,

33
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,587
and he had hair,
and he ate with utensils.

34
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,092
-What was that last thing you said? Ah.

35
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,094
Isn't that your wife, Homer?

36
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,097
Don't be ridiculous.
My wife worships the ground I walk on.

37
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:46,768
Marge,
it's what I call "harsh reality time."

38
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,979
Your husband sees you as nothing.

39
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,275
- Oh. Okay. Well, thank you.
- No, no, no, don't hang up.

40
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,777
The pig has made you
into his mother.

41
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,989
You are not the hot love object
you deserve to be.

42
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,367
- Really?
- I'm as sure of it as I'm sure
my voice is annoying.

43
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,495
Tonight, the second
he comes through that front door,

44
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,167
you've got to tell him you're fed up,
and if he doesn't start loving,
you will be leaving.

45
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,294
Leave Homer?

46
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,379
- Don't use his real name!
- Leave Pedro?

47
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,092
- Can you be that honest?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,179
- You'll tell him right when
he comes home from work.
- Yeah!

49
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,599
- Say it likeyou mean it.
- Yeah!

50
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,893
- Attagirl.

51
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,979
Come on, Bart. Not again.

52
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,273
- Where's your sense of humor?

53
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,692
- Moe's Tavern.
- Hello. Is Al there?

54
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,195
- Al?
- Yeah, Al. Last name, Coholic.

55
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,197
Lemme check.

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,200
Phone call for Al, Al Coholic!

57
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,162
- Is there an Al Coholic here?

58
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,001
Wait a minute. Listen,
you little yellow-bellied rat jackass.

59
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,462
If I ever find out who you are,
I'll kill ya!

60
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:03,595
I hope you do find
that punk someday, Moe. Fill 'er up.

61
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,765
Is eveything okay?
Usually you have a quick one,

62
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,685
some peanuts, beefjerky,
pickled eggs, and you're outta here.

63
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:13,772
Let's just say I don't feel
like goin' home tonight. Jar, please.

64
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,067
Hey, you can level with me.

65
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,362
- You got a domestic situation?
- You might say that.

66
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,365
My wife's gonna leave me
'cause she thinks I'm a pig.

67
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,367
- Homer.
- What?

68
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,996
- Marge is right. You are a pig.
You can ask anyone in this bar.
- What?

69
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,373
Hey, Barney, am I a pig?

70
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,669
You're no more of a pig than I am.

71
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,964
- Oh, no!
- See? You're a pig.

72
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,676
Barney's a pig. Lary's a pig.
We're all pigs.

73
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,470
Except for one difference.

74
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,265
Once in a while,
we can crawl out of the slop,

75
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,393
hose ourselves off
and act like human beings.

76
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,564
Homer, buy your wife some flowers and
take her out for a night on the town.

77
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,567
Candles, table cloth,
the whole nine yards.

78
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,863
Gee, a romantic evening.
Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.

79
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm not done. After dinner,

80
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,869
the two of you are going to check
into the fanciest motel in town...

81
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:14,166
and not check out until
the next morning, if you get my drift.

82
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,377
I read you loud and clear.
Heh, heh, heh, heh!

83
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,172
- Wow, a quarter past 6:00.

84
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,801
- What's keeping Dad?
- Yeah, who'd possibly be late
on meatloaf night?

85
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,973
Uh, I'd like some flowers.

86
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,685
- What kind of flowers?
- You know, pretty ones, not dead.

87
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,271
We have some beautiful
long-stem roses.

88
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,691
- They're $55 a dozen.
- One, please.

89
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,499
- Hey, Mom.
- How 'bout some grub?

90
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,001
- Aaah!

91
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,982
Your
husband sees you as nothing, as nothing.

92
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,901
The pig has made you
into his mother, his mother.

93
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,071
You are not the hot love object
you deserve to be,

94
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,073
deserve to be,
deserve to be.

95
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:32,369
If he doesn't start loving, leave him,
leave him, leave him, leave him.

96
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,591
Marge, I, uh--
love you.

97
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,593
No, that's not good.

98
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,596
Marge, honey, I love you.

99
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,598
Oh. Um--

100
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,602
Marge, I love ya, baby.

101
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,479
Marge, sweetie,"hooney," honey--

102
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,274
Ah, this'll never work.

103
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,203
- I love you, Marjorie.
- Oh, Homer.

104
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,164
I love you too.

105
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,166
Mmmwha!

106
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,793
- A little predinner entertainment.

107
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,588
- Moe's Tavern.
- Is Oliver there?

108
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,882
- Who?
- Oliver Klozoff.

109
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,177
Hold on. I'll check. Oliver Klozoff!

110
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,596
- Call for Oliver Klozoff!

111
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,477
And I made reservations
at the Chez Paree.

112
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,688
But, Homer, it's so expensive.

113
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,066
It matters not, mon frere.
And after desserts,

114
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,069
we'll adjourn to our second-floor room
at the Offramp Inn.

115
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,279
Oh, Homer!
I feel giddy!

116
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,573
Wait. What about a baby-sitter?

117
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,575
- Oops.
- Not to wory.

118
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,704
Listen, ya lousy bum.
If I ever get a hold of you,
I'll cut your belly open.

119
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,290
Goodness. Must be a crossed wire.

120
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,505
- Rubber Baby Buggy
Bumper Baby-sitting Service.
- This is Marge Simpson.

121
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,966
- I'd like a baby-sitter for the evening.
- Wait a minute.

122
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,968
The Simpsons.

123
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,971
Lady, you've gotta be kidding!

124
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,393
- Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper
Baby-sitting Service.

125
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,895
Hello. This is Mr. S-Sampson.

126
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,398
Did your wife just call a second ago?

127
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,067
- No, I said Sampson, not Simpson.
- Thank God!

128
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,696
Those Simpsons,
what a bunch of savages!

129
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,699
- Especially that big-ape father.
- Doh!

130
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,493
Actually, the Simpsons
are neighbors of ours,

131
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:41,165
and we've found them to be a quite
misunderstood and underrated family.

132
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:44,084
Mom, you look so glamorous.

133
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,671
Well, tonight is a vey special night.

134
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,799
Your father is taking me out
for dinner and dancing.

135
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,093
- Dad dances?
- Like an angel.

136
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,887
Ba, ba

137
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,890
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
ba-ba, ba, ba

138
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,601
Ba, ba, ba, ba-ba

139
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,605
- Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
ba, ba, ba-ba
- Work that body, Homer.

140
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:09,193
- You know, one day you'll learn
to move like your old man.
- Not if l can help it.

141
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,070
Son, there's not a woman alive...

142
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,781
who can resist a man
who knows how to mambo.

143
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,993
- You don't have a clue, do you, Dad?
- Out, boy.

144
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,288
- Out!
- What a grump.

145
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,668
Hm. Hm.

146
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,505
Hmm! Hm, hm.

147
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,674
Hmm? Hee.

148
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,302
Smooth as a baby's behind!

149
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,805
Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba

150
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,892
- Precious, I think I hear the doorbell.

151
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,895
I think you're right, dumplin'.
Bart! Get the door!

152
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,980
Aye, aye, mambo man.

153
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,776
Oof!

154
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,991
- Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
ba-ba, ba, ba
- You must be the baby-sitter.

155
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,078
- Yes. I am Miss Botz.
- Just don't stand there, boy.

156
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:05,499
- Help Miss Botz with her suitcases.
- I can handle my own luggage.

157
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,085
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

158
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,879
Here are the phone numbers of
the restaurant where we'll be dining...

159
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,090
and the motel where we'll
be spending the night.

160
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,386
You'll have to put Maggie to bed now,
but Bart and Lisa can stay up
for another hour.

161
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,180
Until then, they can watch
a tape from our video libray.

162
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,767
Oh, boy! The Happy Little Elves
Meet the Curious Bear Cub.

163
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,478
Oh, the Elves! The Elves!

164
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,398
- Bye, kids! Watch out for the boy.

165
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:33,277
Mmmwha! Bye, now.
Mmmwha! Be good.

166
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,071
- Mmmwha! Gotta go.
- Ba, ba

167
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,699
Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
ba-ba, ba, ba

168
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,077
Come, children.
Let's go watch The Happy Little Elves.

169
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,289
We've seen The Crappy Little Elves
about 14 billion times.

170
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,584
- Maybe we can watch some real TV.
- We're gonna watch the tape.

171
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,587
Aw! That's merely suggested
viewing matter, lady.

172
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,797
Mom lets us watch
whatever the hell we want.

173
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,300
I said you're gonna watch this tape.

174
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,469
And you're gonna do what I say,
or I'm gonna do something to you.

175
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:04,474
And I don't know what that is, because
everybody has always done what I say.

176
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,066
They all look so tasty,

177
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,069
but I think I'll eat
this one right there.

178
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:20,282
- Why don't you pick one
that's a little more frisky, sir.
- Why?

179
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,202
Well, when you choose one
that's floating upside down,

180
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:27,206
it somewhat defeats the purpose
ofselecting a live lobster.

181
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:32,002
Oh, okay. Then I'll take
that one there with the beady eyes.

182
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,589
Excellent choice, sir.
May I lead you to your table?

183
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,966
Oui, oui. After you.

184
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,677
And I'll be seeing you later.

185
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,598
Help! Help!

186
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,602
Faster, faster!
We gotta save Bubbles.

187
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,772
Oh, man, I can't take it anymore.

188
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,192
- But I want to see what happens!
- You know what happens.

189
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,194
They find Captain Kook's treasure.

190
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,197
All the elves dance around
like idiots. I puke. The end.

191
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,992
Bart, you're just like Chilly,
the elf who cannot love.

192
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,370
- Now for some real TV.

193
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:09,373
All right!
America's Most Armed and Dangerous.

194
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,792
Oh, no! Bart!
We'll have nightmares!

195
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,294
Relax. This is cinema verite.

196
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,673
When the brutal, slow-motion killing
starts, I'll tell you to shut your eyes.

197
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:22,094
The Cue Ball Killer should be considered
extremely armed and dangerous.

198
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:26,181
if you think you've seen him,
call 1 -800-U-SQUEAL.

199
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,684
Homer, you look just like a little boy.

200
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,771
- 'Cause I'm so care free?
- No, because you're wearing a bib.

201
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,696
- More champagne?
- Mmm.

202
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,781
Whoops. Time for a fill-up.

203
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:46,869
Garcon! Another bottle of
your second-least-expensive champagne.

204
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,788
The defenseless youngsters were tied up
and gagged in the living room...

205
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,291
while the bandit roamed
through the house at will,

206
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:56,795
stealing the valuable objects it took
the family a lifetime to shop for.

207
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,483
You know, Marge,
this is just like when we were dating.

208
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:22,404
Except for one thing--
no chaperone.

209
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,406
Ho, ho, hoo!

210
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,993
The Baby-sitter Bandit has left a trail
ofher daring nighttime robberies...

211
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,078
across the continental
United States.

212
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,080
She could be lurking anywhere,

213
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,875
about to descend upon another house
full of unsuspecting dupes.

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,877
- Eee!
- Wow!

215
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,172
In a moment, we will show you a picture
of the real Baby-sitter Bandit,

216
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,883
Miss Lucille Botzcowski.

217
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,594
- Remember, she may be using
a clever alias...
- Botz!

218
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:51,099
and should be considered
armed and dangerous!

219
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,602
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

220
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,981
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

221
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,369
Run for it!

222
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,793
1 -800-U-SNITCH. No, U-SQUEAL.

223
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,796
- Oh, no!

224
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,801
Don't forget to tell me
when you see the Offramp.

225
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,303
Oh, thereit--

226
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,681
went.

227
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,685
No problemo.
We'll just get off at the next exit.

228
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,489
Bart.

229
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,284
Bart.

230
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,871
Bart. Bart.

231
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,998
Hmm.

232
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,001
Time to brush your teeth,
wash your face...

233
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,503
and say your prayers.

234
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,299
Are you in... here?

235
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,801
Oh! Homemade pickled beets.

236
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,181
Go ahead. Take 'em all.

237
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:20,105
Seeing as no one was hurt, I think it
would be really silly to dwell on this.

238
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,608
- Come on! Come on!

239
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,568
- Finally!

240
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,570
Hello, vigilant viewer.

241
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,489
You have reached
America's Most Armed and Dangerous.

242
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:33,869
I'm calling to report the Baby-sitter
Bandit! She's in our house right--

243
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,498
Come on, Marge.
Let me carry you over the threshold.

244
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,876
Okay, but watch out.
Don't slam my head like last time.

245
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,879
Sheesh! Eleven years ago,
and you've never forgotten it!

246
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,174
- Don't muss my hair!
- Ohh! Oh! Oh!

247
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,009
Yi! Oh! Yeow!

248
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:49,885
Yi! Oh! Yeow!

249
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,179
- Whee! This is fun!

250
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,807
We know who you are, Miss Botz.

251
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,685
Or should I say Miss Botzcowski?

252
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,980
- You're the Baby-sitter Bandit.
- You're a smart, young man, Bart.

253
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:06,193
- I hope you're smart enough
to keep your mouth shut.
- He isn't.

254
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:10,072
You're crazy if you think you're gonna
get awaywith this. You can't--

255
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,408
I'm really not a bad person.
Here. While I finish up,

256
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,370
you guys can watch the rest
of your favorite videocassette.

257
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,792
Quiet, Bart!
Let's make the best of this.

258
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:27,297
Maybe I'll go slip into something
a little more comfortable.

259
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:31,301
Oh! Your blue thing with the things?

260
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,680
- You'll see.
- Well, shake a leg, mama.

261
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,778
Kidstuff!

262
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,780
Hardly worth it.

263
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,782
Lottajunk.

264
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,285
Soileds.

265
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,078
Stupid Sampsons.

266
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,676
- Maggie! Maggie!

267
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,971
Come here!

268
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,309
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye, eveybody!

269
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,477
- Bye!
- Yea!

270
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,479
Maggie,

271
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,608
wanna watch
The Happy Little Elves again?

272
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:32,404
Okay, but you have
to untie me first.

273
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,701
Oh, Homer!

274
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,081
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

275
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,003
- Oh, so you got out of your crib.

276
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,089
I guess you need
to be tied up too.

277
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:57,804
- Maggie, where are you?

278
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,807
- Maggie! Maggie!

279
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,976
- Heh, heh, heh.

280
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:24,289
Homer, would it spoil the mood
if I called home,

281
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,084
you know, just to check on the kids?

282
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,972
Homer, wake up!
There's no answer at home.

283
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,392
- So?
- So I'm worried.
I think we should go home.

284
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,394
All right.

285
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,105
I suppose my work here is done.
Heh, heh, heh, heh!

286
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:51,108
Hello, vigilant viewer.
How may we help you?

287
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:55,696
We caught her!
We caught the Baby-sitter Bandit!
She's tied up at our house right now.

288
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,699
- Ask if there's a reward.
- Is there a reward?

289
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,994
- If she's convicted, we get T-shirts!
- Yeah!

290
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,497
- How come all the lights are on?
- I don't like the looks of this.

291
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,584
- Miss Botz!

292
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,586
- Good Lord!

293
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,589
What have those little
hellions done now?

294
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,175
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry!

295
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,386
Please turn off the TV.

296
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,973
I can't tell you how chagrined we are
about all of this.

297
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,684
Oh, these things are heavy.

298
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,897
Just so there's no hard feelings,
here's double your pay.

299
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,899
- No, no, triple.
- Thank you.

300
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:35,110
- Mr. Sampson,
can I give you a bit of advice?
- Sure.

301
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:38,405
- Don't turn your back
on that boy for a second.

302
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,408
Ain't that the truth?
You know, one time he--

303
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:44,411
- Huh?

304
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,500
This way to the scene of the crime,
men! I got her tied up in the den.

305
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,502
Just a minute, young man!

306
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,671
I don't know what kind of shenanigans
you've been pulling this time,

307
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:58,091
but I just had to untie your baby-sitter
and pay her off so that--

308
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,678
Excuse me. Are you saying to the world
that you just aided and abetted...

309
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,890
the escape of the notorious
Baby-sitter Bandit?

310
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:08,101
- The what?
- The Baby-sitter Bandit.

311
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,688
Oh, uh, a-are you sure
this microphone works?

312
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:15,275
Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her.
This is on, right?

313
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,778
Because actually
it was quite a struggle.

314
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,405
Oh, Homer!

315
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,991
Have you ever seen a kung fu movie?
It was just like that.

316
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:26,286
But now I know her moves.
So, if you're listening to me, lady,

317
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:30,791
you'd better think long and hard
before tying something like this
on Homer Simpson again!

318
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:36,672
- Lord, help me.
I'm just not that bright.

319
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:40,092
Oh, Homer, don't say that.

320
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,886
The way I see it,
if you raise three children...

321
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,890
who can knock out
and hogtie a perfect stranger,
you must be doing something right.

322
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,476
Yeah.

323
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,896
Yeah!

324
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,482
Mmmmwha!

325
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,901
Honey, can we make up again?

326
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,903
Oh, my goodness!

327
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,910
- Shh!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
