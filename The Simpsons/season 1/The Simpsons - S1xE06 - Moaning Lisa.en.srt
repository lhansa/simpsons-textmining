1
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,276
Lisa! Lisa, are you
still in there?

2
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,655
What's the problem? Did you fall in?
Lisa!

3
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,786
- Sorry, Dad. Women and children first.
- What the--

4
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,169
- Where the hell are my keys?

5
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,464
Who stole my keys?
Come on. I'm late for work.

6
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,467
Oh, Homer, you'd lose your head if it
weren't securely fastened to your neck.

7
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,678
- Did you check the den?
- The den! Great idea.

8
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,189
Warm. No, cold.

9
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,191
- Colder. Ice cold.
- Huh?

10
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,861
-Do you know where my keys are?
-No. I'm talkin' about your breakfast.

11
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,863
- Did you try the rumpus room?

12
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,282
Rumpus room?
Great idea.

13
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,285
- Oh, Dad.
- Huh?

14
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,287
- Doh!
- Oh, Homer.

15
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,874
- Here.
- I'm sorry, everybody,

16
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,877
but I've only got two cupcakes
for the three of you.

17
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:53,590
Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed
down more than enough cupcakes
over the past three decades to--

18
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,592
- Bart!
-just take mine.

19
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,262
A simple cupcake
will bring me no pleasure.

20
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,182
- Oh, yeah!
- All right!

21
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,394
All right, class.
From the top.

22
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,188
One, and two,
and three, and--

23
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:12,192
My county, 'tis of thee

24
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,487
La da da da da dee

25
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,456
- Lisa!

26
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,794
Lisa Simpson!

27
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,173
Lisa, there's no room for crazy bebop
in " My County 'Tis of thee."

28
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:38,177
- But Mr. Largo, that's
what my county's all about.
- What?

29
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,889
I'm wailing out for the homeless
family living out of it’s car.

30
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:46,268
The Iowa farmer whose land has been
taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats.

31
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,478
The West Virginia coal miner,
coughing up--

32
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,190
That's all fine and good, but none
of those unpleasant people...

33
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,483
are going to be
at the recital next week.

34
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,486
Now, class.
From the top.

35
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,157
- Five, six, seven.

36
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,585
Every day at noon a bell rings, and
they herd us in here for feeding time.

37
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,672
And we sit around like cattle, chewing
our cuds, dreading the inevitable--

38
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,674
Food fight!

39
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,763
Come on, Lis! What are you
waiting for? Chuck that spaghetti.

40
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,890
I choose not to participate.

41
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,274
Lisa, we are playing
dodge ball here.

42
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,694
The object of the game is
to avoid the ball by weaving
or ducking out of it’s path.

43
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,280
In other words,
to dodge the ball.

44
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,659
Listen, missy, just tell me
why you weren't getting
out of the way of those balls.

45
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,662
I'm too sad.

46
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,872
Too sad to play dodge ball?

47
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,667
That's ridiculous.
Now, let's see some enthusiasm.

48
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,377
Play ball!

49
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,594
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

50
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:10,060
In the red trunks,
with a record of 48 wins and no losses,

51
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,479
the undisputed champ
of this house,

52
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,190
Battling Bart Simpson!

53
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,860
- Whoopee, whoo!

54
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,987
And in the lavender trunks,

55
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,365
with a record of zero wins
and 48 defeats--

56
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,369
Oh, correction.
Humiliating defeats,

57
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,955
-all of them by knockout--
- Must you do this every time?

58
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,791
Homer "The Human Punching Bag"
Simpson!

59
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,173
Doh! Stupid joystick!

60
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,592
Three seconds, folks.
A new record.

61
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,760
Hey, no. I'm not down.
I'm-- Get up, you!

62
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,888
Get off the mat.
Okay. Here we go.

63
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,891
Yo, chump, you back again?

64
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,269
Get outta the way!
How come he's not ducking?

65
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:56,190
Wait a minute. I can't get my--
Get out of the way, stupid!

66
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,567
- Homer?
- Not now, Marge!

67
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,987
- Get out of the corner!
- They sent a note from school.

68
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,364
What did you do this time, you little
hoodlum? Oops, get outta the way!

69
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,867
I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it.
There's no way they can prove anything.

70
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,494
No, Bart.
This note isn't about you.

71
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,080
It isn't?
There must be some mistake.

72
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,458
Hey, you're right.
This note's about Lisa.

73
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,960
- Lisa?

74
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:38,273
She doesn't look sad.
I don't see any tears in her eyes.

75
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,275
It's not that kind of sad.

76
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,569
I'm sory, Dad, but you
wouldn't understand.

77
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,280
Oh, sure, I would, princess.
I have feelings too.

78
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,492
you know, like,
" My stomach hurts."

79
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,370
Or "I'm going crazy!"

80
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:55,290
Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee
and tell him all about it.

81
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,960
I'm just wondering
what's the point?

82
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,296
Would it make any difference
at all if I never existed?

83
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,758
How can we sleep at night when there's
so much suffering in the world?

84
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,594
Well, I-- Uh--

85
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,763
Come on, Lisa.
Ride the Homer horsey!

86
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,266
Giddyap. Whee!

87
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,562
Lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs
and I'll draw you a nice hot bath.

88
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,564
That helps me
when I feel sad.

89
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:22,276
- Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well.
- Thanks for knowing I mean well.

90
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,487
Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself
a real problem on your hands.

91
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,657
Yeah, right.
Uh, Bart, vacuum this floor.

92
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,993
Hey, man.
I didn't do anything wrong!

93
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,997
In times of trouble you've
got to go with what you know.
Now, hop to it, boy!

94
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,295
Thinks he's some big
stupid Homer. Oh, man.

95
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,756
I'll show him.
He thinks he's so big.

96
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,179
- Enjoy your bath?
- No, not really.

97
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,765
Oh, too bad.
Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming.

98
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,268
Maybe now I'll get the pleasure
of scrubbing your tub.

99
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,980
So typical of Bart.
All he thinks about is himself.

100
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,774
Hey, don't say stuff like that
about me to Maggie.

101
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,860
She's on my side anyway.

102
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,196
- Is not. Is not.
- Is too. Is too.

103
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,157
- Is not.
- Is too! Watch. I'll prove it.

104
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,994
Maggie. Come to the one
you love best.

105
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,373
No, Maggie. Come here, girl.
Come tome.

106
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,584
Come on, Maggie!
The choice is obvious.

107
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,796
No, Maggie. Don't go for the glitter.
Look for substance.

108
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,177
All right, Maggie,
just go to Bart.

109
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,180
Exactly. Come to the one
you love best.

110
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,567
Oh, no! Come on!
Don't let the--

111
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,987
Aaah! Oh, no,
not again.

112
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,991
Get over to the--
Aaah!

113
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,376
Gee, Dad, you're
really bad at this.

114
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,170
I am not.
It's just that I...

115
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,381
- couldn't concentrate
with that infernal racket.

116
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,383
Lisa! Lisa.

117
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,768
Lisa, what did I tell you about playing
that sax-a-ma-thing in the house?

118
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,897
I was just playing the blues, Dad.

119
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,486
Lisa, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell.

120
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,573
Go ahead. Play your blues
if it'll make you happy.

121
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:36,869
No. That's okay, Dad.
I'll just work on my fingering.

122
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:40,789
Unless my fingers clacking
on the keys is too loud for you.

123
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,959
- Let's hear it.

124
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,464
You just clack
as loud as you want, Lis.

125
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,270
I've gotta find that sound.

126
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,790
That was beautiful.
What's it called?

127
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,793
Oh, it's a little tune
that I call...

128
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:30,464
the "I Never Had
an Italian Suit Blues."

129
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:42,976
Wait, Margie. Before you go out
that door, let's put our happy face on,

130
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,190
because people know how good a mommy
you have by the size of your smile.

131
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,080
What the--

132
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,582
- Put up your dukes, Homer.

133
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,961
Bart, go easy on me.
I'm your dad.

134
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:13,966
I am going easy on you,
but you're so old and slow...

135
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,093
and weak and pathetic.

136
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:20,180
No! Bart, no!

137
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,983
- Homer, wake up, wake up.
- Huh? Oh, man.

138
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,777
Here, let me wipe off
the drool.

139
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,989
you know, Marge, getting old
is a terrible thing.

140
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:41,869
I think the saddest day of my
life was when I realized I could
beat my dad at most things.

141
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,496
And Bart experienced
that at the age of four.

142
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,498
So, why are you
still awake?

143
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,877
I'm still tying to figure out
what's bothering Lisa.

144
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,464
I don't know. Bart's such a handful,
and Maggie needs attention.

145
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,467
But all the while, our little
Lisa is becoming a young woman.

146
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:01,763
Oh, so that's it.
This is some kind of underwear thing.

147
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,766
Mmm. Good night, Homer.

148
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,691
Now, now low b-flat.

149
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,489
Okay, Lisa.
"Altissimo" register.

150
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:28,499
Very nice. Very nice.
I once ruptured myself doin' that.

151
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:32,085
- Thanks, Mr. Murphy.
- My friends call me Bleedin' Gums.

152
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,087
Eww. How'd you get
a name like that?

153
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,466
Well, let me put it this way.
you ever been to the dentist?

154
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,969
- Yeah.
- Not me. I suppose I should go to one,

155
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,472
but I got enough pain
in my life as it is.

156
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,474
I have problems too.

157
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:50,687
Well, I can't help you, kid. I'm just a
terrific horn player with tons of soul.

158
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,482
- But I can jam with you.
- Okay.

159
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,080
Oh, I'm so lonely

160
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,791
Since my baby left me

161
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,460
I got no money

162
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,463
And nothing is free

163
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,174
Oh, I been so lonely

164
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,177
Since the day I was born

165
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,888
All I got is this rusty

166
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,474
This rusty old horn

167
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,185
I got a bratty brother

168
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,188
He bugs me every day

169
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,899
And this morning
my own mother

170
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,861
She gave
my last cupcake away

171
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,488
My dad acts
like he belongs

172
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,199
He belongs in the zoo

173
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,869
I'm the saddest kid

174
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:51,290
In grade number two

175
00:13:56,295 --> 00:14:00,591
you know, you play pretty well
for someone with no real problems.

176
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,885
Yeah, but I don't
feel any better.

177
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,179
The blues
isn't about feelin' better.

178
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,683
It's about makin' other people
feel worse and makin'
a few bucks while you're at it.

179
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,269
Which reminds me, if you're
ever in the neighborhood,

180
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,063
I'm playing in a little club
called the jazz Hole.

181
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,482
Lisa! Get away from
that jazzman!

182
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,776
- But Mom! Can't I stay
a little longer?
- Come on.

183
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,864
We were worried about you. Nothing
personal. I just fear the unfamiliar.

184
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,384
Today's fire
raced through downtown Springfield,

185
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,679
gutting Symphony Hall, the Springfield
Museum of Natural History,

186
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,599
the Springfield Arts Center
and Barney's Bowl-a-rama.

187
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,601
- Officials said the--

188
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,978
Oh, no! Marge!

189
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,398
- Marge, are you all right?
- No! I'm very upset.

190
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,777
Then you've heard. Oh, God.
What are we gonna do?

191
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,364
- The lanes were kinda warped,
but, oh, the food.
- I'm upset about Lisa.

192
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,075
- Oh, me too.
- Me three. What are we talking about?

193
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:12,579
- Bart!
- Do you think you're being nice
enough to your sister, Bart?

194
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,666
- Oh, yeah, easy.
- You do love her, don't you?

195
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,168
- Oh, Mom.
- Well, you do. Don't you?

196
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,880
Don't make me say it.
I know the answer. You know the answer.

197
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,174
He knows the answer.
Let's just drop it. Okay?

198
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,760
Okay, Bart.
you don't have to say it,

199
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,887
but you do have to have
a loving attitude.

200
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,473
Be nice to your sister.

201
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,686
-Okey-dokey.
-Go on, Bart. No time like the present.

202
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,191
- Hi, man.
- I don't want your pity.

203
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,985
- Aw, come on. I'll cheer you up.
- How?

204
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,572
- Yeah. Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.

205
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,574
- Is jacques there?
- Who?

206
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,578
-jacques. Last name Strap.
- Uh, hold on.

207
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,289
Uh, jacques Strap?

208
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,666
Hey, guys, I'm lookin'
for a jacques Strap.

209
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,086
- What?

210
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,173
Aw, wait a minute.
Jacques Strap?

211
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,968
It's you, isn't it,
you cowardly little runt!

212
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:11,680
When I get a hold of you, I am gonna gut
you like a fish and drink your blood.

213
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,686
- Where's your sense of humor, man?

214
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,481
Lisa, you'll be late
for band practice. Let's go.

215
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,791
Uh, give me some quarters.
I'm doing my laundry.

216
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,377
Yeah. Right.

217
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,468
- Where's the video boxing?
- It's over there in the corner.

218
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:52,262
If I were you I really would use
those quarters for laundry.

219
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,264
Wise guy.

220
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:00,771
- Hey, that kid's pretty good.
- Good? Are you kidding?

221
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,774
Over 2.000 fights, and he's still on
his original quarter.

222
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,901
Okay, who's next?

223
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,987
- Me, me, me, me, me!
- No, me!

224
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,698
- Listen, can you teach me
to fight like you do?
- I don't think so.

225
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,993
- Oh, come on.
- I'll tell you what. I'll do
it if you bark like a dog.

226
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,789
you little--

227
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,375
you got yourself a deal, Fido.

228
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:29,383
- Well, looks like you're
all out of quarters, old man.
- That's okay.

229
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,594
With the tips you've given me,
I'm gonna pound the tar out of...

230
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:36,974
- a certain little smarty-pants tonight.

231
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,685
Howie! I thought I told you
to stop wasting your money...

232
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,687
- in this stupid place!
- Sorry, Mom.

233
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,401
And you! A man of your age.
you should be ashamed of yourself.

234
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,362
Excuse me. I think
I hear my wife calling.

235
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,000
Now, Lisa, listen to me.
This is important.

236
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,962
- I want you to smile today.
- But I don't feel like smiling.

237
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:10,883
Well, it doesn't matter how
you feel inside, you know.

238
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,468
It's what shows up
on the surface that counts.

239
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:17,890
That's what my mother
taught me. Take all your
bad feelings and push them down.

240
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,769
All the way down, past your knees,
until you're almost walking on them.

241
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,398
And then you'll fit in, and
you'll be invited to parties,

242
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:31,278
and boys will like you,
and happiness will follow.

243
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,780
Oh, come on.
you can do better than that.

244
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,367
Oh, that's my girl.

245
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,078
I feel more popular already.

246
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,999
- Hey, uh, nice smile.
- Thanks.

247
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:48,587
Hey, what are you talkin' to her for?
She's just gonna say somethin' weird.

248
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,674
- Not me.
- You know, I used to think
you were some brainiac,

249
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,093
but I guess you're okay.

250
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,472
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, why don't you come over
to my house after practice?

251
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,891
- You could do my homework.
- Okay.

252
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,684
Mmm.

253
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:06,563
Five minutes, people. Now, Miss Simpson,
I hope we won't have a repeat...

254
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,900
of yesterday's out burst
of unbridled creativity.

255
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,362
- No, sir.

256
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:23,372
- Wow, Mom!
- Hmm. So that's where she gets it.

257
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,376
Lisa, I apologize to you.
I was wrong.

258
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:31,964
I take it all back. Always be yourself.
you wanna be sad, honey, be sad.

259
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:35,968
We'll ride it out with you.
And when you get finished feeling sad,

260
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,970
we'll still be there.

261
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:42,099
From now on, let me do
the smiling for both of us.

262
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,685
Okay, Mom.

263
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,687
I said you could stop
smiling, Lisa.

264
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,397
I feel like smiling.

265
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:54,778
I'm gonna knock you out
one more time, and that's it.
This is getting boring, man.

266
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,573
Just ty not to kill me
too hard, son.

267
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,872
- Whoa!
- Kid, tonight's not your night.

268
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,999
All right, man, you asked
for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

269
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,668
Aha! Blocked it.
You missed me.

270
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,673
- Oh!
- I got you. Ooh.

271
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,884
- Don't try that. I got you blocked.

272
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,304
And the crowd is on its feet as
Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill!

273
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,264
Boys, I'd like
your attention, please.

274
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:26,185
Quiet, Marge! This is my
big moment! Bart "The Bloody
Pulp" Simpson is on the ropes.

275
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,478
He is hoping I'll put him
out of his misery!

276
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,982
Well, you're in luck, Bart!
Here comes my right!

277
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,693
Oh, no!

278
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:39,198
My game, my game!
I could have beat the boy.

279
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:42,284
Marge, how could you?
I was so close.

280
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,996
I'm sorry, but this is more important
than that silly, loud game.

281
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,666
You're right, Mom. I'd just like to use
this occasion to announce my retirement,

282
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,295
- undefeated, from the world
of video boxing.

283
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:57,090
Oh, calm down, Homer.
Lisa has an idea that she thinks...

284
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,385
- would be fun for the whole family.

285
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,472
The next song was written
by a friend of mine,

286
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,475
one of the great
little ladies of jazz.

287
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:28,789
I got this bratty brother

288
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,791
He bugs me every day

289
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,796
And this mornin'
my own mother

290
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,465
Gave my last cupcake away

291
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,179
My dad acts like
he belongs, y'all

292
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,599
-He belongs in the zoo
- What?

293
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,769
I'm the saddest kid

294
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:54,398
In grade number two

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
