2
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:39,361
So, how was the office
birthday party?

3
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:41,496
Oh, it was delightful.

4
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:44,866
The frosting on the cake
was this thick.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,103
And Eugene Fisk--
my poor sucker of an assistant--

6
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:50,005
didn't know the fruit punch
was spiked...

7
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:52,107
and he really made
an ass of himself...

8
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:54,109
putting the moves on the new girl
in Valve Maintenance.

9
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,812
Does this girl like him?

10
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,814
I have to warn you, Marge,

11
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,816
I think the poor young thing
has the hots for yours truly.

12
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,784
Homer.

13
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,686
Just keeping you
on your toes, babe.

14
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,192
Two hundred and thirty nine pounds!
Oh, I'm a blimp.

15
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:13,295
Why are all the good things
so tasty?

16
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,697
From now on,
exercise every morning.

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,369
You're not a blimp,
Homer.

18
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:23,372
You're my big
cuddly teddy bear.

19
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:25,507
Aw, baloney. Yeah, right.

20
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:29,378
Aw, baloney. Yeah, right.

21
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,513
Oh, give me a break.

22
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,883
Wow, cool, man!

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,802
Oh, no!

24
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:55,304
Two hundred
and thirty nine pounds?

25
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:57,306
I'm a whale.

26
00:02:57,406 --> 00:03:01,711
Why was I cursed with this weakness
for snack treats?

27
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:04,814
Well, from now on,
exercise every morning, Homer.

28
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,818
Oh. Don't strain
yourself, dear.

29
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,820
Good idea, Marge.

30
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:13,189
By the way,
this Friday night...

31
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,892
I'm gonna be attending a little
get together with the boys at work.

32
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:18,394
Eugene Fisk is marrying
some girl in Valve Maintenance.

33
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:21,597
Homer, is this
some kind of stag party?

34
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:25,101
No, no, Marge.
It's gonna be very classy.

35
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:27,403
A tea-and-crumpets
kind of thing.

36
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:29,405
Eugene Fisk.
Isn't he your assistant?

37
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:33,409
- No! My supervisor.
- Didn't he used to be your assistant?

38
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,913
- What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?
- Sorry, Homer.

39
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:40,083
- Uh-oh, it's the "fe-mailman."

40
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,418
Female carrier, Bart.

41
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:45,088
Lady, where's my spy camera?

42
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,090
- "Where's my spy camera?"
- Where's my spy camera?
Where's my spy camera, lady?

43
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:49,225
- Every day for the last six months--
- Where's my spy camera?

44
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:53,096
Where's my spy camera?
Where's my spy camera?

45
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:55,698
Here's your
stupid spy camera!

46
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:58,101
Oh.
Thanks, ma'am.

47
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:04,407
Whoa, man.
Look at the size of this thing.

48
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:06,409
I wonder
if it really works.

49
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:11,414
'Cause I got
a lot of spying to do.

50
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:20,590
Bart!
What are you doing?

51
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:23,927
Sorry, Dad.
The answer to that is top secret.

52
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,401
- Oh, Bart.
- What?

53
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:33,804
Go take some wildlife pictures
or something.

54
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,844
Ew, gross.

55
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:44,014
Mom, Bart was taking
a picture of his butt.

56
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:47,351
Oh, sure. Like I'm really gonna
take a picture of my butt.

57
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:50,220
Stop it, you two.
And put on some nice clothes.

58
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,222
Since it's just
the four of us tonight,

59
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:55,726
- we're having dinner
at The Rusty Barnacle.
- Yea, fried shrimp!

60
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,795
Aw, Mom. Can't we just
grab a burger at--

61
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,031
Only four of us?
Who escaped?

62
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:03,534
Your father.
He's having a boys' night out.

63
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,036
Just as I was asking myself,

64
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:09,740
"Where did my seven-year-old
boy get the money...

65
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,909
for a Father's Day present?"

66
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:14,411
I opened the box.

67
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:18,715
And inside was little
Eugene's baseball glove.

68
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,218
He had given me the one thing...

69
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:23,554
that mattered most to him
in the whole world.

70
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,925
Eugene, when I see you--
the one thing that matters
most to me in the whole world--

71
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:29,927
married tomorrow,

72
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,296
I'm going to know
just how you felt that day.

73
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:35,733
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, son.

74
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:38,736
Where am I,
the planet Cornball?

75
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:41,739
Hey, don't worry. Things are gonna pick
up once the entertainment gets here.

76
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:45,442
- Ooh, entertainment.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:53,117
Ahoy! I spy
the children's menu.

78
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:56,620
- Ahoy, this place bites.
- Bart.

79
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:58,923
So, what's it gonna be,
me little bucko?

80
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:01,225
Hm, let's see.

81
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:03,828
This evening
I shall go for the...

82
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,430
- squid platter,
- Ew.

83
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,432
With extra tentacles, please.

84
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:11,135
Oh, Bart. Excuse me, sir.

85
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:14,005
The party next door seems
to be a little raucous.

86
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:16,240
Could you please ask them
to quiet down a little bit, please?

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,309
Aye, aye.

88
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:20,745
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

89
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,253
Hey, try to keep
it down, guys.

90
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:31,322
- Okay?
- Hey, shut up.

91
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:34,258
Open the door and lie on the floor
said Barnacle Bill the sailor

92
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:36,761
Hmm.

93
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,632
Here you go.

94
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,435
There you are.
For the baby.

95
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:48,006
And one squidplatter,
extra tentacles.

96
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:54,245
- Bart, quit fooling around
and eat your dinner.
- Yeah, eat it, Bart.

97
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,748
Ugh. May I please be excused
for a minute?

98
00:06:56,748 --> 00:07:00,819
Okay, but don't dawdle.
Your food will get cold.

99
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:03,021
Okay, Eugene.

100
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,757
One last taste
of bachelor freedom.

101
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,832
Presenting
Princess Kashmir,

102
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,935
queen of the mysterious East.

103
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,444
Now this is
what I call a party.

104
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:29,714
How do I tell you this, my boy?
We're in hell.

105
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:33,218
Look at him squirm.

106
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:36,354
- You care to dance?
- She wants you, Homer.

107
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:39,224
Go for it, Homer!

108
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:47,132
Shake his buns.

109
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,138
I'm sorry.
I don't usually laugh like this.

110
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:58,143
Ai, caramba.
Wow, man.

111
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:04,149
Oh, this is the most fun
I've ever had in my life.

112
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,358
The meeting of the Future Photographers
of America is now in session.

113
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,528
We would like to welcome
our new member, Bart Simpson.

114
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,165
Whoa. People, people.
Don't applaud. Let's get to work.

115
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,840
My goodness.
Quite exciting.

116
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,976
- Extremely sensual.
- The subtle gray tones recall
the work of Helmut Newton.

117
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,978
Who's the sexy lady,
Bart?

118
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,648
Beats me. But the guy dancing
with her is my pop.

119
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,751
- Wow!
- He brings to mind
the later work of Diane Arbus.

120
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,853
Bart, I'd really appreciate
a print of your masterwork.

121
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,855
- Me too.
- Yeah, come on.

122
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,757
Sorry, guys.
No can do.

123
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,725
Aw. Oh.

124
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,428
Come on, Bart. You're gonna make me
a print, aren't you?

125
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,865
Will you swear not to let another
living soul get a copy of this photo?

126
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,034
- Okay. Yep.
- Cross your heart and hope to die?

127
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,470
- Stick a needle in your eye?
Jam a dagger in your thigh?
- Yep. Yep.

128
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,671
Eat a horse manure pie?

129
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,540
- Yep.
- Well, okay.

130
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,844
- Pst. Look what I got.
- Whoa. I gotta have a copy of that.

131
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,846
- Sorry.
- Aw, come on.

132
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,181
Well, okay.

133
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,856
Hey, Bart. How come Milhouse gets a
copy of your girlie picture and I don't?

134
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,859
- I thought I was your friend too.
- Well, okay.

135
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,549
Son, why are you wasting your time
with this sleazy trash?

136
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,252
Sorry, Dad.

137
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,756
Wait till I show
the guys at work this little doozy.

138
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,260
Mike, this is Al.

139
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,264
Just wanted to thank you for the
"informative memo" you faxed me.

140
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,266
Whoops. Here comes the boss.
Gotta go.

141
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,436
Reverend Lovejoy,
your wife confiscated this...

142
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,672
from one of the boys in the choir.

143
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,774
Why this sheep has strayed
from my own flock. His name's--

144
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:11,077
Homer Simpson, sir,
a low-level employee...

145
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,246
- in sector 7-G.
- Simpson, huh?

146
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,448
- A family man?
- Wife and three kids, sir.

147
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:20,053
I'd like to see our self-styled
Valentino tomorrow morning, Smithers.

148
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,760
What are we laughing at?

149
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,635
One glazed and
one Scratch-'N-Win, please.

150
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,371
You look familiar, sir. Are you
on the television or something?

151
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,874
Sorry, buddy. You got me confused
with Fred Flintstone.

152
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,277
Oh. Liberty Bell.

153
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,446
Another Liberty Bell!

154
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,448
One more and I'm a millionaire.

155
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,451
Come on, Liberty Bell,
please, please, please.

156
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,254
D'oh!
That purple fruit thing.

157
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:57,190
- Where were you yesterday?
- Hey, hey. Looking good.

158
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,394
- What do you want, pal?
- Hey mister.

159
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,696
Do, do, do, do, do

160
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,398
Do dee do dee do

161
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:07,067
Well, a "do dee do dee do"
to you too, pint size.

162
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,469
Jeez, you get
a lot of nutcases in here.

163
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,072
Oh, sir, I've seen things
you can't imagine.

164
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,475
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I hear you, buddy.

165
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,477
Whew. Full moon.

166
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,982
Hmm. Still got it.

167
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,459
What is the meaning of this?

168
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,898
Meaningless, Marge. Don't even
attempt to find meaning in it.

169
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,900
There's nothing between me
and Princess Kashmir.

170
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,403
- Princess who?
- Hey, my photo.

171
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:43,971
- Your photo?
- Uh-oh.

172
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,073
- Why you little--
- Why you big--

173
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,075
- Bart, go to your room.
- I'm out of here.

174
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,178
- Look, Marge, honey, baby, doll, I--
- Homer,

175
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:54,081
I don't even want
to look at you right now.

176
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,217
What are you saying, honey?

177
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,586
- But where will I sleep?
- My suggestion...

178
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,988
is for you to sleep
in the filth you created.

179
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,990
Would a motel be okay?

180
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:14,602
Oh, I knew you'd
come to your--

181
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:18,906
Here. If you have any soul left,
you'll need these.

182
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:21,108
I know I will.

183
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:36,190
What's the matter, Homer?
Hottest ladies' night in months...

184
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,860
- and you're not even
checking out the action.
- Oh, Moe.

185
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:43,364
My wife gave me the old heave ho
because of some lousy picture.

186
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:46,000
- What, this one?
- D'oh!

187
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,003
- So, uh, where are you
staying tonight, Homer?
- Motel, I guess.

188
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:52,306
Oh, no.
No pal of mine is gonna stay...

189
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,676
in some dingy flophouse.

190
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,312
Ah.

191
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:59,480
If you get hungry
in the middle of the night,

192
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:02,116
there's an open beer
in the fridge.

193
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:05,687
Look, Barney.
See the row of tiny lights up there?

194
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,089
The middle one
is my house.

195
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,291
Someone must have left
the porch light on.

196
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,293
Hey that's rough,
pal.

197
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,297
Hello, Marge.

198
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:17,699
- You left your damn porch light on.
- Barney!

199
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,366
- You left your damn porch light on.
- Barney!

200
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,502
Homer's not
made of money, you know.

201
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:22,504
- Who is this?
- Don't listen to him, Marge. He's--

202
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:25,006
- Oh, it's you.
- Oh.

203
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:27,676
Homer, you're overwrought.

204
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,811
Why don't you
unwind a bit?

205
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:31,880
Party down the hall.

206
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,882
You know, this
apartment complex caters...

207
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:37,118
to upscale young singles like me.

208
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:40,188
No, Barn. I just want
to crawl into bed.

209
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:42,991
Suit yourself, Homer.
Nighty-night.

210
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:56,204
I wonder when
Dad's coming home.

211
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:10,185
Homer Simpson.

212
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,387
Homer Simpson.
Report at once to Mr. Burns' office.

213
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,823
Oh, no.

214
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,193
What in blue blazes
do you think you're doing, Simpson?

215
00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:20,495
- What do you mean, sir?
- I mean this.

216
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,698
A plant employee carrying on...

217
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:26,001
like an oversexed
orangutan in heat.

218
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:29,004
This is a family
nuclear powerplant, Simpson.

219
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:31,206
Our research indicates
that over 50 percent of our power...

220
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:33,208
is used by women.

221
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:36,211
I will not have you offending my
customers with your bawdy shenanigans.

222
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,714
It won't happen again, sir.
I promise.

223
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:41,717
- May I get out of your sight now?
- Just a second, Simpson.

224
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,719
Smithers, would you leave
the room for a minute?

225
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,721
Yes, sir.

226
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:49,325
Simpson,

227
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,595
I am by most measures
a successful man.

228
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:58,000
I have wealth and power
beyond the dreams of you
and your clock-punching ilk.

229
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,636
And yet, I've led
a solitay life.

230
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:03,506
The fair sex
remains a mystery to me.

231
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:06,008
You seem to have
a way with women, a certain--

232
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:08,144
how shall I put it--

233
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,146
animal magnetism.

234
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:12,014
Help me, Simpson.

235
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:14,016
Tell me your secret.

236
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,519
Uh, Mr. Burns, in spite
of what everybody thinks,

237
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,721
I'm no lover boy.

238
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:21,023
Simpson,
I'm asking you nicely.

239
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,825
- I don't really know, sir.
- Simpson!

240
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,727
Well, I wine them,
I...

241
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,729
dine them,
bring them flowers,

242
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,731
write them love poetry, sir.

243
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:30,700
Of course.

244
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,703
It's simplicity itself.

245
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:35,838
I won't forget this,
Simpson.

246
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:40,209
Now return to your work and tell
no one of what transpired here.

247
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:48,284
- Anybody home?
- Hi, Daddy.

248
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:50,286
Welcome back, Dad.

249
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,223
- How's your mom?
- Still kind of ticked off.

250
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,292
Yeah.
Good luck, man.

251
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,728
Oh, thanks, boy.

252
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:01,230
Hello, Marge.

253
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:03,333
It's me, Homer.

254
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,735
Are you still mad?

255
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:09,239
You are still mad.
Don't need to say it.

256
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:11,708
I'm your loving husband.
I can read you like a book.

257
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,710
I'll just have
some milk.

258
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,912
Look, I'm not drinking
out of the carton.

259
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:16,412
Look, I'm not drinking
out of the carton.

260
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,718
Come on, Marge! Please forgive me.

261
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:25,422
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

262
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:28,625
Homer, you don't even know
why you're apologizing.

263
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:31,227
Yes, I do.
Because I'm hungry,

264
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,930
my clothes are smelly,
and I'm tired.

265
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,932
I've been
thinking, Homer,

266
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:38,435
and you know what bothers me
the most about this whole thing?

267
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,737
You taught Bart
a very bad lesson.

268
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,806
Your boy idolizes you.

269
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:45,242
- Oh, he does not.
- Yes, he does, Homer.

270
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,744
And when he sees you
treating women as objects,

271
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,813
he's going to think
that it's okay.

272
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:51,815
You owe your son
better than that, Homer.

273
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:53,717
So what should I do, Marge?

274
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:56,720
Well, I think you
should take Bart...

275
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,356
to meet this exotic
belly-person.

276
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:01,992
I want him to see
that she's a real human being...

277
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,728
with real thoughts
and real feelings.

278
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:08,031
I want Bart to see you apologize
for the way you treated her.

279
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:10,934
Okay. Your wish is my command,
my little--

280
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,936
Do it!

281
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:21,945
Princess Kashmir?
You must mean April Flower.

282
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:24,248
She's working
over at the Girlesque.

283
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,923
See, I'm tying to teach my son here
about treating women as objects.

284
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,925
Oh, that's a good idea.

285
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:36,927
Uh, but April's over
at Foxy Boxing tonight.

286
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,929
Just let me say
that it is an honor...

287
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,931
to have Springfield's number-one
swinger here with us to--

288
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:42,933
Forget that.

289
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,636
I'm teaching my boy a lesson.
Is she here or not?

290
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,638
Uh, try Mud City.

291
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,744
We're gonna try one more place,
the Sapphire Lounge.

292
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,746
Bart! I said look
at the floor.

293
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:00,751
...he really loves me--

294
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:05,456
There she is. Hey, Princess, it's me,
the guy from the snapshot.

295
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:07,558
Oh. Oh, hi.

296
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,760
Places, ladies, places.

297
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:12,263
Can I get just a little
cooperation? It's show time.

298
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:15,266
I'm here because I want to apologize
for treating you like an object.

299
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:17,268
- Uh-huh.
- I also want my boy...

300
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:20,438
to find out that you're more
than just a belly.

301
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:23,074
I want him to meet the woman behind
all the spangles and glitter...

302
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:25,743
and find out that she has
thoughts and feelings too.

303
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:29,847
- Oh, well, okay.
But can we make it quick?
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

304
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:31,849
Could you tell him
a little about yourself?

305
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:34,252
- Well, uh, my real name
is Shawna Tifton.
- Uh-huh.

306
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:36,320
- My pet peeve is rude people.
- Uh-huh.

307
00:18:36,454 --> 00:18:39,323
- And my turn-ons include silk sheets...
- Uh-huh.

308
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:41,325
- and a warm fireplace.
- Thank you very much, ma'am.

309
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,461
We'll be on our--

310
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:46,264
- I've heard them say so often

311
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,967
They can love
their wives ooh

312
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:52,770
But I think
that's just foolish

313
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:54,772
Men must have hearts

314
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,841
Made of stone

315
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,843
Now my heart is made

316
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,845
- Cool, man.
- Of softer stuff

317
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:03,081
Get out of my cage.

318
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,750
- My boss will freak out.
- Oh, no.

319
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,153
- A pretty girl can't
look my way without
-Don't. Don't!

320
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:11,155
- Don't. No.
- Get out. Get out of here.

321
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:13,858
Get your hands off.

322
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,960
A new romance

323
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,263
Oh I could love
a million girls

324
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:20,465
And every girl a twin

325
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:23,034
I could love a Chinese girl
an Eskimo or--

326
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:34,779
Get off of my stage,
fat boy.

327
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:37,048
Hey, it's the guy from the picture.

328
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:43,221
- Homer Simpson!
- Sorry, partner.

329
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:45,457
I didn't recognize you
at first.

330
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:47,559
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's an honor...

331
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:50,662
to have a real swinging cat
with us tonight.

332
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:53,231
Homer Simpson,
party guy.

333
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:59,171
Mr. Maestro.

334
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:01,973
Oh I could love
a million girls

335
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,476
And every girl a twin

336
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:06,478
Yeah I could love
a Chinese girl

337
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:08,480
An Eskimo or Finn

338
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:12,484
I could dig a Deutschland chick
a girl with golden curls

339
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:15,454
In fact I think
that we could love

340
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:20,459
About a million girls

341
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,562
Heh. Hey.

342
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:25,564
Ooh. Look out.

343
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:29,368
Yeah.

344
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:32,371
- How does he do it, Smithers?
- He's a love machine, sir.

345
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:34,540
Da, da, da

346
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,375
Way to go, Dad.

347
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,681
Uh-oh.
Wait a minute.

348
00:20:42,748 --> 00:20:45,350
Wait a minute.
Stop the music.

349
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:50,756
Quiet, please.
I have something to say. Quiet.

350
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,758
You with the hair,
down in front.

351
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:55,861
Oh, no.
He's sunk even lower.

352
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:58,864
I have something to say
to all the sons out there.

353
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:01,767
To all the boys, to all the men,
to all of us.

354
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,769
It's about women,

355
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,940
and how they are not mere objects
with curves that make us crazy.

356
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,576
No, they are our wives,

357
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:12,678
they are our daughters,
our sisters,

358
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:15,748
our grandmas, our aunts,
our nieces and nephews.

359
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:18,484
Well, not our nephews.

360
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:20,486
They are our mothers.

361
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:24,256
And you know something, folks?
As ridiculous as this sounds,

362
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:27,359
I would rather feel the sweet breath
of my beautiful wife...

363
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:30,496
on the back of my neck
as I sleep...

364
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,666
than to stuff dollar bills
into some stranger's G-string.

365
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:39,372
Am I wrong?
Or am I right?

366
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:44,277
My wife gets the cutest little thing,
right here, when she smiles.

367
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:47,680
- This is my Suzie.
- Oh, she's so cute.

368
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,682
Here's mine.

369
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:52,385
You know, my mom sounded
a little down the other day.

370
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:54,387
I'd better
give her a call.

371
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:56,255
- Homer.
- Marge.

372
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:05,965
All right, folks. Show's over.
No more to see, folks.

373
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:10,870
Come on. Only sick people
want to see my folks kiss.
