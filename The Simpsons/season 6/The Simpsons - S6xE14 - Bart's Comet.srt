1
00:00:03,832 --> 00:00:05,242
BART'S COMET

2
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:32,154
And now, to top off...

3
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:35,007
...our most propane-explosion-free
Science Week ever...

4
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,228
...our grand finale:
The launching of a weather balloon.

5
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,262
Go, weather balloon!
Hurrah for science, whoo!

6
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:45,577
"Hurrah for science, whoo"?

7
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:49,604
I can't say I approve of the "whoo,"
but the "hurrah" was quite heartening.

8
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:51,718
Release the balloon.

9
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,268
- Yeah!
- All right!

10
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:10,678
No!

11
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:18,200
- I don't think I really captured the eyes.
- Bart, if you have a failing...

12
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:20,600
...it's that you're always
demanding perfection.

13
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,133
If you have a failing.

14
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,200
Whoever brings down that balloon
doesn't have to learn fractions.

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,033
Careful, children. That's my car.

16
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:39,133
- Destroy that balloon.
- Aye.

17
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:46,475
Tango 14, we're being fired at.
I'm getting an ID on the bogey now.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,678
Iraqis again.
Launching Sidewinder missile.

19
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:59,322
Missed him.
Launching second Sidewinder missile.

20
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:06,915
This is what happens when
you cut money out of the military...

21
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,559
...and put it into healthcare.
- It's a good program.

22
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:12,373
Just give it a chance, that's all I ask.

23
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:21,898
It won't come down for months.
Curse the man who invented helium.

24
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:24,373
Curse Pierre Jules César Janssen.

25
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:27,051
Now to find out who did this.

26
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,576
- Bart, empty your pockets.
- Empty my pockets, you say?

27
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:34,678
Well, certainly,
but I fail to see how...

28
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:39,085
Blueprints of the dummy, notarized
photos of you making the dummy...

29
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:41,322
...and an alternate wording
for the banner.

30
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:46,169
- Race you to Utah, Milhouse.
- Okay.

31
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,051
I am going to punish you
for this, Bart.

32
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,559
And it won't just be
a simple caning this time.

33
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:56,508
Because you have impeded science,
you must now aid science.

34
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:01,254
Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will
assist me with my amateur astronomy.

35
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:04,203
Taking down coordinates,
carrying equipment and so forth.

36
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:07,186
- Four-thirty in the morning.
- There's a 4:30 in the morning now?

37
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:14,133
Top of the hour, time for the news.
But of course, there is no news yet.

38
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,000
Everyone's still asleep in their comfy,
comfy beds. Good night, everybody.

39
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,933
Still dark. Better use the generator.

40
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,567
There's nothing more
exciting than science.

41
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:50,467
You get all the fun of sitting still,
being quiet...

42
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:53,100
...writing down numbers,
paying attention.

43
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,667
Science has it all.

44
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,800
Is that the telescope
we'll look through?

45
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,133
Yes, but you won't be looking
through it. I forbid it.

46
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:02,600
But you don't need a telescope
to enjoy astronomy.

47
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:05,500
There are all the constellations
you've heard so much about.

48
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:09,133
There's Orion, the Swan,
the Chariot Race.

49
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,467
Why don't they look anything
like their names?

50
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,367
You do have to use your imagination.

51
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,733
Look, there's the Three Wise Men.

52
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,233
Who names these things?

53
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:20,267
Whoever discovers them.
I've been hoping I can find something...

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,367
...that would be named after me.
- You've never found anything?

55
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,133
Once. But by the time
I got to a phone...

56
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,167
...my discovery had already been
reported by Principal Kohoutek.

57
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:35,230
I got back at him, though.
Him and that little boy of his.

58
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,138
Anyway, that's why I always keep
a cellular phone next to me.

59
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:41,241
Now, this morning we're
gonna be mapping...

60
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,448
...a square of sky that's thought
to be empty. I hope it's not.

61
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:46,690
So, what am I supposed
to do exactly?

62
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:49,448
Just write down my findings
as I give them to you.

63
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:54,690
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 22 minutes declination.

64
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:56,724
No sighting.

65
00:04:57,276 --> 00:05:02,552
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 23 minutes declination.

66
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:05,000
No sighting.

67
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:10,931
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 58 minutes declination.

68
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,807
No sighting.
Did you get that one, Bart?

69
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:15,652
- Hell, no.
- Good.

70
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,672
My stars. Give me the phone, quick.

71
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:24,813
Check out 6-19-14-59.

72
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:36,089
No. No, there's no need for that.
It's already named after me.

73
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:38,941
It's pretty close to the ground.
Maybe I can catch it.

74
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:43,169
Don't touch the telescope, Bart.
Even a slight change in elevation...

75
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,485
...can destroy a whole morning's work.

76
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,579
All hands on deck.
Pirates off the port bow.

77
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,760
Hey.

78
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,813
Observatory? This is Bart Simpson.

79
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:10,015
I see something in the sky at 4-12-8,
and the last number is seven.

80
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,840
What did you do today, Bart?

81
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,142
What didn't I do?

82
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,211
- "Boy Discovers Comet."
- What?

83
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:53,215
"A young Springfieldianite
has discovered a new comet...

84
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,617
...to be known as
the Bart Simpson Comet."

85
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:58,487
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.

86
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,190
But then you've always
been proud of me.

87
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,326
Yes.

88
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,735
Won't you join us, Bart?

89
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:16,808
I guess so.

90
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:21,180
As the first student at Springfield
Elementary to discover a comet...

91
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:25,318
...we're very proud to make you
a member of our very select group.

92
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:28,355
Welcome to Super Friends!

93
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:30,991
Welcome, Super Friend!

94
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:35,229
I am called Ham,
since I enjoy Ham Radio.

95
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:41,970
This is E-Mail, Cosine, Report Card,
Database and Lisa.

96
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:44,740
Your nickname will be Cosmos.

97
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,310
Well, I'm done eating. Goodbye.

98
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,314
- Goodbye, Cosmos.
- Bye-bye.

99
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,750
Perhaps some night
you could show us your comet.

100
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:56,119
- There it is right there.
- I make it a point...

101
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:58,889
...never turn my head unless
I expect to see something.

102
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,728
Naturally, we can't see your comet in
broad daylight and without a telescope.

103
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:07,066
But you don't need a stupid telescope.
It's right there.

104
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:10,470
Oh, no, no! This isn't right at all!

105
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:13,974
It must be coming toward us
at a fantastic speed.

106
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,945
Don't you realize what's happening?
Your comet will collide with Earth.

107
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,014
Everything in its path will be killed.

108
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:22,884
I knew you'd try to find something
wrong with my comet.

109
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:26,255
You've always been petty and small,
right from the beginning.

110
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:30,626
- We must alert the proper authorities.
- To the observatory!

111
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,800
We are the Super Friends

112
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,468
Hey, shut up.

113
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,009
- Dear God!
- Warren...

114
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,979
...we've talked about you
hogging the eyepiece.

115
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:55,287
Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle.

116
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:59,993
Ain't been blown
for nigh on to three years.

117
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:02,162
Trouble a-brewing.

118
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:06,634
Fellow citizens, when I learned
about the impending crisis...

119
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:09,937
...I caught the very next plane
to Springfeld. Field.

120
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:17,646
First, yes, there is a comet in the sky.
And yes, it is going to hit Springfield.

121
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:21,217
You don't need to applaud that.

122
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:24,521
Now, here's what we think
the impact might look like.

123
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:26,456
Show them, Jerry.

124
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,764
Oh, dear God, no!

125
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:38,504
Fortunately, we have a plan.
Professor Frink?

126
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,339
Hi. Good evening, ladies and...

127
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:42,742
Einstein, what's the plan?!

128
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:44,878
All right, just take your seat.

129
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:47,914
Now, working with former
Carter-administration officials...

130
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:50,851
...and military men who were
forced into early retirement...

131
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:53,754
For various reasons which
we won't go into here, okay?

132
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:56,357
- We have planned this defense
for the city.

133
00:09:56,624 --> 00:10:00,662
As the comet hurdles toward the city,
our rocket will intercept it...

134
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:02,831
...and blow it to smithereens. Right!

135
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:08,771
That will be the end of our Mr. Comet.

136
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,840
We're saved!

137
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:24,923
Will you all stop worrying about that
stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed.

138
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,593
Didn't you hear what that guy
in the building said?

139
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,762
- But, Dad, don't you think...?
- Lisa.

140
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,601
The reason we have elected officials
is so we don't have to think all the time.

141
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,771
Just like that rain-forest scare
a few years back.

142
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,275
Our officials saw there was a problem,
and they fixed it, didn't they?

143
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,078
- No, Dad. I don't think...
- There's that word again.

144
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:10,141
- Homer, what if this doesn't work?
- Well, then I have a backup plan.

145
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:12,944
See, while the unprepared
are still sitting around...

146
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,881
...twiddling their thumbs and going:

147
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:23,003
- Dad!
- So anyway, we get in our car...

148
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,809
...and take the bridge out of town.
While all the while, they're still going:

149
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:33,148
Dad, they're firing the rocket!

150
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,885
All right!

151
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,972
It blew up the bridge! We're doomed!

152
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:57,375
It's times like this
I wish I were a religious man.

153
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,581
It's all over, people!
We don't have a prayer!

154
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:15,731
And like Icarus,
the rocket foolishly soared too high...

155
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,802
...and lost control of its
servo-guidance mechanism...

156
00:12:19,902 --> 00:12:22,072
...leaving us with some...

157
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,007
...six hours to live.

158
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:28,145
So let's go live now to the charred
remains of the only bridge out of town...

159
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:31,115
...with Arnie Pie
and "Arnie in the Sky."

160
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:34,853
With the bridge gone and the airport
on the other side of the bridge...

161
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:38,523
...a number of citizens are attempting
to jump the gorge with their cars.

162
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,293
It's a silent testament
to the never-give-up...

163
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,597
...and never-think-things-out
spirit of our citizens.

164
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,068
With our annihilation imminent, our
government has snapped into action.

165
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,705
We go live now via satellite to the
floor of the United States Congress.

166
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:15,208
Hey, I got an idea.

167
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:17,877
We can play a game to pass the time.

168
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,450
I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal,
and you all try to guess what it is.

169
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:29,691
- It's a pig.
- It's a cow, man.

170
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,726
- It's a pony.
- No, it's a goat.

171
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,663
- You know, one of them lady goats.
- There are no lady goats.

172
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,099
- A lady goat is a sheep.
- I believe she's right.

173
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,368
- You're crazy.
- What's it to you?

174
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:41,704
- What's it to me?
- Hey, it's a pony!

175
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:44,541
- Shut up!
- Doesn't anybody care that I'm hungry?

176
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:48,479
Stop it, stop it. Can't you see
this barnyard-noise guessing game...

177
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,015
...is tearing us apart?

178
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:00,359
Say, Moe, was it a duck?

179
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:04,263
I don't like it...

180
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,135
No! No! Shut up! Shut up!
Stop it! Stop it!

181
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:10,971
I can't take this anymore.

182
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:14,241
I can't let that brave man
out there die alone.

183
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:17,178
I'm surprised and disgusted
by all of you.

184
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:19,347
Especially his children.

185
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:21,349
I'm going out there.

186
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:24,253
And it was a baby ox.

187
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,121
- He's right, you know.
- About the ox?

188
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:30,827
About everything, damn it!
Hey, Homer, wait up. I wanna die too.

189
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,929
- If you are going, I am going.
- Me too.

190
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,532
- Me too.
- I'm out of here. Make way.

191
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:38,515
Radio reception in there sucked.

192
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:17,848
Run!

193
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:26,224
- Look!
- It's breaking up!

194
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:42,876
- Cool.
- We're saved!

195
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:48,649
Sure makes you appreciate
the preciousness of life.

196
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:54,122
Let's go burn down the observatory
so this'll never happen again.

197
00:19:56,158 --> 00:20:00,096
I can't believe that extra-thick layer
of pollution that I've picketed against...

198
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:03,099
...is what burned up the comet.
- What's really amazing...

199
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:07,638
...is that this is exactly what Dad
said would happen.

200
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:09,773
Yeah. Dad was right.

201
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,511
I know, kids. I'm scared too.
