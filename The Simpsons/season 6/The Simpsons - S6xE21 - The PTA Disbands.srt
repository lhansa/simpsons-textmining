1
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:04,849
The PTA Disbands

2
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:40,319
This bus has seen better days.

3
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:42,634
Well, at least it's safer
than the old bus.

4
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,124
Time to move.
The hole's getting bigger.

5
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,641
Seymour, the children are playing
in the hole again.

6
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,117
Shouldn't you get that fixed?

7
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,634
Edna, you know they just
cut the school's budget.

8
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:04,916
If I had the money,
I'd fix the exhaust leak.

9
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:07,366
I think it's causing
some of our low test scores.

10
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:16,225
The battlefield is just
a half-mile ahead.

11
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:18,809
Begin braking procedure!

12
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:29,446
This Civil War cannon has been fully
restored and is in ready-to-fire condition.

13
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:31,896
But it's a good thing
we're not firing it...

14
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:36,695
...because it happens to be aimed at the
main support leg of that lookout tower.

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,789
People don't realize that these cannons
are very sensitive...

16
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:44,446
...and the slightest jolt could
set them off.

17
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:48,070
Of course, for safety reasons...

18
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:50,386
...we don't keep the cannon loaded.

19
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:52,466
It's just common sense.

20
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:59,144
Otto, why don't you get some more gas.
Here's the credit card.

21
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,862
And a mint for afterwards.

22
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:05,453
Five dollars a child?
Last year it was free!

23
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:06,963
New ownership.

24
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:15,252
But we don't have that kind of money.
In fact, no school could afford...

25
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:25,789
Here's the admission,
plus something for you.

26
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,104
See that they get
a little extra education.

27
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:30,151
Yes, sir, Principal Valiant!

28
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,507
He thinks he's so hot ever since
he swept the Princi Awards.

29
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,017
Those things are rigged.

30
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:41,326
On May 21, 1864, the men
of the 9th Bearded Infantry...

31
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,943
...were sunning and fluffing
their beards in the sun.

32
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:48,372
Suddenly, enemy troops
crested that hill over there.

33
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,695
Fort Springfield,
we surrender unconditionally!

34
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:53,876
We're sick!
We need leeches...

35
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:56,829
...and hacksaws to saw off
our gangrenous limbs.

36
00:02:56,997 --> 00:03:00,721
But the Springfield brigade was
too brave to accept their surrender.

37
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,614
Come on, boys. Those white flags
are no match for our muskets!

38
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:06,359
Charge!

39
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:09,379
And the Springfielders heroically
slaughtered their enemies...

40
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,493
...as they prayed for mercy.

41
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,809
It's hard to see what's going on.
I can only make out the fat soldiers.

42
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,252
All right, children. Switch.

43
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,889
Hey, they're trying to learn for free!

44
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:28,742
- Get them!
- Use your phony guns as clubs!

45
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:30,856
Run, children.

46
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:34,715
Start the bus, Otto! Start the bus!

47
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:38,507
Damn! I shouldn't have
eaten the mint first.

48
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,560
Okay, hop on.

49
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:44,379
Wait! Wait!

50
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:56,889
Seymour, because of
your penny-pinching...

51
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,177
...we're coming back from a field trip
with the fewest children yet.

52
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:03,499
God bless the man who invented
permission slips.

53
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,358
I think I got your lunch.

54
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:11,419
I didn't think this was for me.

55
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,217
Seymour, the teachers are fed up.

56
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:18,365
You have to put money
back into the school.

57
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,077
You've cut back on everything.

58
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:22,962
Salaries, supplies, the food.

59
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,848
I don't care what you say,
I can taste the newspaper.

60
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,808
Shredded newspapers add much-needed
roughage and essential inks.

61
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:32,291
Besides, you didn't notice
the old gym mats.

62
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:35,177
There's very little meat
in these gym mats.

63
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,426
Our demands are very reasonable.

64
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:40,647
By ignoring them, you're selling out
these children's futures.

65
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:44,170
Oh, come on, Edna! We both know
these children have no future!

66
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:51,251
Prove me wrong, kids.
Prove me wrong.

67
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,446
I've never seen them
fight like that.

68
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,835
I'm worried that all this posturing
could lead to a teachers' strike.

69
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,150
Strike, eh?

70
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,372
My bones are so brittle.

71
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,392
But I always drink plenty of "malk"?

72
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,855
How do you expect us to teach
with these supplies?

73
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:14,238
This pointer's so old,
it's worn down to a nub.

74
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,855
It still points, doesn't it?

75
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,969
Stop that! And look at this.

76
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:22,224
The only books we have are ones
that were banned by other schools.

77
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:27,123
Well, the kids have to learn about
Tek War sooner or later.

78
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,244
Go away, Bart.
This is not a good time.

79
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,922
I saw you two fighting.

80
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,446
I'm worried there could be a strike
and the school would shut down.

81
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,258
I'm sure you'd really hate that.

82
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:40,647
- There's not going to be a strike, Bart.
- Yeah.

83
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:43,432
Skinner said you wouldn't
go through with it.

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,419
- Skinner said that?
- Well, I had to clean it up a little.

85
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:50,311
But basically, Krabappel said you'd give
the teachers everything they want.

86
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,721
- She did?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,472
She said you'd fold faster
than Superman on laundry day.

88
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,352
We'll see about that.

89
00:05:56,553 --> 00:06:00,244
Simpson, I always thought you were
sneaky and manipulative.

90
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:03,835
Now I see you're
really a very sensitive little boy.

91
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:05,714
Thank you, sir.

92
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:10,043
You're being totally unfair,
and the teachers won't stand for it!

93
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,197
Teachers! You don't have
the guts to strike!

94
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:16,654
You don't have the guts
to take us all on!

95
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,298
- That's it!
- Strike!

96
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,835
Attention, this is
an emergency broadcast.

97
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:33,667
All is well in the school.
My authority as principal is total...

98
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,379
Hey, give me that!

99
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:39,170
Attention, teachers. We're on strike!

100
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:42,962
Oh, no. Strike?

101
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,278
Miss Hoover, are you on...?

102
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,459
Go home, children.

103
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:49,976
Hello?

104
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,801
Mrs. Pommelhorst?

105
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,519
I'd like to get down now.

106
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,627
Bart? Lisa? What are you two
doing home so early?

107
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:08,849
- Great news, Mom!
- Horrible news, Mom!

108
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,735
The school's on strike! Maybe forever.

109
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:14,251
Overload. Pleasure overload.

110
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:18,714
Luckily I've prepared for this,
so I'm not too worried.

111
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:26,164
Sit up straight. Eyes forward.
No talking.

112
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:29,318
Is that gum? Is that gum?
Is that gum?

113
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:31,701
Oh, yeah.

114
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:36,802
Bart, leave that crowbar here. You know
I don't like you prying and jimmying.

115
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:39,553
Mom! Dad! Great news!
The teachers are on...

116
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:42,204
- We heard.
- And we already hired a tutor.

117
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:44,822
Well, looks like we'll be
staying late today...

118
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,372
...to make up for all this dilly-dallying.

119
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:00,325
Awesome.

120
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:04,620
You, at the crane!
Spin around real fast!

121
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:13,278
Now, you! Dump 3 tons of sand
onto that Porta-Potty.

122
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:21,097
Hey! Can't you tell my voice
from a 10-year-old kid's?

123
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,245
Ay caramba!

124
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:41,198
Hey, that little boy
is playing three games at once.

125
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:42,305
- Checkmate.
- Checkmate.

126
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:43,446
- Checkmate.
- Dang.

127
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:48,412
Lousy teachers, trying
to palm off our kids on us.

128
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,131
Dad, by striking, they're trying
to change management...

129
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,446
...so they can be happier
and more productive.

130
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:56,835
Lisa, if you don't like your job,
you don't strike.

131
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:01,097
You just go in every day
and do it really half-assed.

132
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,842
That's the American way.

133
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,661
I've got textbooks.
But without state-approved syllabi...

134
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:08,748
...and standardized testing,
my education can only go so far.

135
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,265
Honey, maybe you should
relax a little.

136
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:15,292
Relax? I can't relax!
Nor can I yield, relent or...

137
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,245
Only two synonyms?

138
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:22,574
Oh, my God!
I'm losing my perspicacity!

139
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:26,701
Well, it's always in
the last place you look.

140
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:36,125
If we were in school this week,
what do you think we'd be learning?

141
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,668
Get away from me.

142
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,682
Good news, people!

143
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:43,742
I'm happy to announce another union
has joined us in a sympathy strike!

144
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,158
The Piano Tuners Local 412!

145
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,977
Now for Operation
Strike-Make-Go-Longer.

146
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:58,843
You know, I heard Skinner say
the teachers will crack any minute.

147
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:05,789
Skinner said we'll crack,
purple monkey dishwasher.

148
00:10:05,923 --> 00:10:07,299
Well, we'll show him!

149
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:10,923
Especially for that "purple
monkey dishwasher" remark.

150
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,420
Seymour, you are truly incompetent!

151
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:18,574
- Well, I hardly think it's fair...
- Dummy up, you!

152
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:21,594
Listen to those passing motorists
who support the teachers.

153
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,071
Fifteen-minute recess, Milhouse.

154
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,722
The recess assignment is
chapters three through seven.

155
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:33,440
Yay! Recess!

156
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:37,635
I found a hive of killer bees.
You want to go throw rocks at it?

157
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:41,225
Sorry, Bart. I'm deeply immersed
in the Teapot Dome scandal.

158
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:44,581
However, it might
be feasible in a fortnight.

159
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,729
I can play in two weeks.

160
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,447
I just can't believe Stark
would stoop to that...

161
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:58,809
...and right in the middle
of Montana and Dakota's wedding.

162
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:08,285
What do you mean, the bank
is out of money? Insolvent?

163
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:11,003
You only have enough cash
for the next three customers?

164
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,533
Just a second here.
No, no. I don't have your money here.

165
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,956
It's in Bill's house, and Fred's house.

166
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:27,144
Hey, what the hell you doing with
my money in your house, Fred?

167
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,835
Grade me! Look at me!

168
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,748
Evaluate and rank me!

169
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:40,231
I'm good, good, good
and, oh, so smart!

170
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,177
Grade me!

171
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,909
I'm worried about the kids, Homie.

172
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,560
Lisa's becoming very obsessive.

173
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:57,781
This morning, I caught her trying
to dissect her own raincoat.

174
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:03,385
I know. And this perpetual-motion
machine she made today is a joke.

175
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:06,170
It just keeps going faster and faster.

176
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,217
And Bart isn't doing very well either.

177
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:10,600
He needs boundaries and structure.

178
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:14,929
There's something about flying a kite
at night that's so unwholesome.

179
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:17,278
Hello, Mother dear.

180
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:20,734
That's it! We have to get them
back to school.

181
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:24,090
I'm with you, Marge.
Lisa, get in here.

182
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:28,352
In this house, we obey
the laws of thermodynamics!

183
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:34,694
All right. I'd like to call this meeting
of the PTA to or-diddly-order.

184
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,311
Let's see if we can't put
an end to this strike fuss.

185
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:40,466
- Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin.
- Boo.

186
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:43,956
Oh, "boo" yourself!
Our demands are simple.

187
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:48,654
A small cost-of-living increase and better
equipment and supplies for your children.

188
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:50,936
- Yeah, all right!
- Give it to them!

189
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,090
Yeah, in a dream world.
We have a very tight budget.

190
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,942
To do what she's asking,
we'd have to raise taxes.

191
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,426
- Raise taxes?
- They're too high as they are now.

192
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:01,338
- I've had enough.
- Taxes are bad.

193
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,915
It's your children's future.

194
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,969
- Children's future.
- Yes, children are important.

195
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,217
- It'll cost you.
- Oh, the taxes.

196
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,667
They're gonna raise taxes.

197
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:13,452
- Come on.
- All right, that's a good point.

198
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,298
Oh, yeah, that sounds...

199
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:18,419
- Oh, yeah, the taxes.
- That means money.

200
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:20,566
The finger thing means the taxes.

201
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,426
I guess this is a case where
we'll have to agree to disagree.

202
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,506
- I don't agree to that.
- Neither do I.

203
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:29,526
This is a dilly of a pickle.

204
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:32,613
Oh, my God! The PTA has disbanded!

205
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:37,781
No, no! The PTA has not disbanded.

206
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:44,862
We do have an emergency plan,
in case of a prolonged strike, right here.

207
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:46,506
Let's see.

208
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:50,533
"Replace teachers
with superintelligent cyborgs.

209
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:53,956
Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet,
use people from the neighborhood."

210
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:59,962
Talking out of turn, that's a paddling.

211
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,855
Looking out the window,
that's a paddling.

212
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:07,580
Staring at my sandals,
that's a paddling.

213
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:12,177
Paddling the school canoe,
you better believe that's a paddling.

214
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:19,056
All right, so the compression
and expansion...

215
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:22,546
...of the longitudinal waves
cause the erratic oscillation...

216
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:25,936
You can see it there.
- Of the neighboring particles.

217
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:28,285
Yes? What is it? What? What is it?

218
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:30,734
- Can I play with it?
- No, you can't play with it.

219
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,922
You won't enjoy it
on as many levels as I do.

220
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,842
The colors, children.

221
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:41,640
Okay, when I call your name,
you say "present" or "here."

222
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,318
No, say "present."

223
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:46,635
Anita Bath.

224
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,662
All right. Settle down.
Anita Bath here?

225
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,615
All right, fine. Fine.

226
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:55,192
Maya Buttreeks.

227
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:01,836
Hey, what are you laughing at? What?

228
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:05,024
Oh, I get it. I get it.

229
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,917
It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it?

230
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:12,038
Well, children, I can't help that.

231
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:21,769
Wow, Bart! I'm impressed the way
you knocked off all those substitutes.

232
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,655
In my weaker moments,
I almost pity them.

233
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,581
Then I just remind myself,
they're trying to teach.

234
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:33,413
I don't know what you did to all those
substitutes, but it's going to stop now.

235
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:34,924
Leopold?

236
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:39,689
All right. You listen up, you little freaks!
The fun stops here.

237
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,279
You're gonna shut your
stinking traps and behave, damn it!

238
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,930
This is one substitute
you're not gonna screw with!

239
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,950
Marge Simpson.

240
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:52,742
Hello, class. Hi, Bart.

241
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,158
Over here, sweetie.
It's me, Mom.

242
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,481
Hi. Hey. Hello!

243
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,643
Well, I'm sure some of you already
know me. I'm Bart Simpson's mother.

244
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,079
Mom.

245
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:15,133
Hey, Bart, what about the booby trap?

246
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,838
- May I?
- Thank you.

247
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,757
- Mama's boy!
- Teacher's pet! Teacher's pet!

248
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:27,180
I meant the other booby trap.

249
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:33,589
Kids have been doing
that one since my day.

250
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,422
So how was everybody's
day at school?

251
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,965
- Horrifying.
- Pointless.

252
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,925
Exhausting. It took the children 40
minutes to locate Canada on the map.

253
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:47,583
Marge, anyone can miss Canada,
all tucked away down there.

254
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:51,408
My teacher's a nightmare. Three kids got
sick from inhaling his ointment fumes.

255
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:54,965
He confiscated everything made of tin.
And then he sent us home early...

256
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,918
...because he got his beard
caught in the pencil sharpener.

257
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:02,817
Oh, okay.

258
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,301
Here.

259
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:09,227
Okay. Let's see.

260
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,609
What if I did this?

261
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:15,032
You're on your own.

262
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:19,630
There's no way I'll get into
an Ivy League school now.

263
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:22,381
At this rate, I probably won't
even get into Vassar.

264
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:26,140
I've had just about enough
of your Vassar-bashing, young lady!

265
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:29,294
Look, Mom. It feels really weird
having you on my turf.

266
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,375
How would you feel
if I started mopping?

267
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,925
I'd be thrilled.
You can start right now.

268
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:37,348
And I'm gonna keep teaching your class,
like it or lump it.

269
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:42,515
Well, then. I guess I'll just have
to get into the crawlspace again.

270
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:45,334
I hate it when he gets in there.

271
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,368
Over here.

272
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,187
Mom, I need a dollar.

273
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:01,375
Since you started teaching,
kids have been taking my lunch money.

274
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,187
And I need that money for candy.

275
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:07,717
Here you go, precious.
Now, go off with your friends.

276
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,737
"Here you go, precious."

277
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:15,368
Why isn't my mom stopping this?

278
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,851
We've created a diversion.

279
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:20,905
That's a very nice jig, Kearney.

280
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:23,321
Now, isn't dancing much more
fun than bullying?

281
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:24,932
Yeah.

282
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,663
That's it.
I can't take this anymore, Milhouse.

283
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:31,710
I've got to get the real teachers back.

284
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:35,099
Bart, you'll never get Krabappel
and Skinner together again.

285
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,321
They're like two
positively charged ions.

286
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,240
Wait, that's it.

287
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:45,334
With your book smarts and my ability
to exploit people with book smarts...

288
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:48,220
...we can figure out a plan
to get them back together.

289
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:52,544
A surprise party for me
in Principal Skinner's office?

290
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:54,993
Well, I don't know, but all right.

291
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:57,544
Me? Go to my office?

292
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:59,591
It's highly irregular, but all right.

293
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,584
You're not coming out
until you reach an agreement.

294
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:05,765
- Let us out, Bart!
- This is not funny, Bart.

295
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,315
- I mean it.
- Stop it, Bart! Let us out right now!

296
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:12,443
- Don't worry. They'll start negotiating.
- Bart, open this door!

297
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:16,503
- Let us out!
- For the love of God, let us out!

298
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:22,544
Come on!
You are gonna be so sorry.

299
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:31,571
- Let us out right now!
- You're gonna be very, very sorry!

300
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,584
Help! Well...

301
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:36,201
...Seymour, I guess we could
start talking.

302
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:38,282
What's the point?
There's no more money...

303
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,000
...unless you've got some magic
new source of revenue.

304
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:44,222
We've got to figure it out.
We're locked in here like prisoners.

305
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,604
Prisoners in our own school.

306
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:56,101
This was a great way
to make extra money...

307
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:59,289
...renting out our cloakrooms
to the overcrowded prison system.

308
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,973
Yo. I used to sit right over there.

309
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:07,779
It's all right, children.
Just ignore the murderer.

310
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,732
And as a bonus, some of our more
troublesome students...

311
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,812
...might be scared straight.

312
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:16,638
Kid, help me break out of here.

313
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:18,852
I'll totally make it worth your while.

314
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,899
I'm listening.
