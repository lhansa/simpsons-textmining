1
00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:05,519
Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)

2
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:37,935
Is there nothing so intoxicating
as the school hallway at early morn?

3
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:42,096
The school normally
doesn't smell so rank.

4
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:47,801
Washbasin fresh. That funk must be
coming from one of the classrooms.

5
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:54,411
Poor fellow.
Crushed by his own water bottle.

6
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:03,136
Willie, sometime over the holiday
weekend, the beloved grade-four gerbil...

7
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:05,083
...Superdude, lost his life.

8
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:08,707
I need you to air out the classroom
and give Superdude a proper burial.

9
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,411
You're lucky you're getting
a decent burial.

10
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,230
Me own father
got thrown in the bog.

11
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,566
What in the name of
Saint Ephesiocritus...?

12
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:32,264
What reeks?

13
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:36,492
- Smells like one of van Houten's.
- It does not.

14
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:42,566
Miss Hoover, the floor is shaking.

15
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,385
Ralph, remember the time
you thought the...?

16
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,338
Now, before we adjourn, I have one last
matter of utmost importance.

17
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,861
I need to send this parcel with the profit
projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena.

18
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:02,708
And it absolutely, positively,
has to be there overnight.

19
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:05,796
- Pete Porter. Pass it on.
- Pasadena. Promptly.

20
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:07,473
Package parcel processing.

21
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:10,997
Perk up. Package of plant profit
projection for Pete Porter in Pasadena.

22
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,876
- Priority?
- Precisely.

23
00:02:24,118 --> 00:02:26,098
Here's your package, Mr. Burns.

24
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,930
My name is the return address,
you senseless dunderpate.

25
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:32,675
Smithers, who is this nincompoop?

26
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:37,138
I've worked here for 10 years and
my boss doesn't even know my name.

27
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:39,185
Well, that's gonna change right now.

28
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:41,400
My name is Homer J. Simp...

29
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:44,520
...son.
- Sounded large when I ordered it.

30
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:47,843
I can't make hide nor hair
of these metric booby traps.

31
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:51,702
My Lord. Such destruction.

32
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,628
Superintendent Chalmers.
How are you going?

33
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,984
Why is it when I heard the word
"school" and the word "exploded"...

34
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:01,131
...I thought of the word "Skinner"?!

35
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:04,520
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Your custodian struck oil.

36
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:08,447
You're standing on top of the richest
elementary school in the state.

37
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,594
We also found this.

38
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,346
Thank you. Superdude.

39
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,151
A nonprofit organization with oil?
I won't allow it.

40
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,366
An oil well doesn't belong
in the hands of...

41
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:28,950
...Betsy Bleeding-heart
and Maynard G. Muskie-vote.

42
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,151
Sir, have you had enough
exercise for this morning?

43
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:35,628
No.

44
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,380
Let's do another 20 miles.

45
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:42,042
I want that oil well.
I've got a monopoly to maintain.

46
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,800
I own the electric company, waterworks,
plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue.

47
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,250
That hotel's a dump and
your monopoly's pathetic.

48
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:52,579
The oil well is not for sale, particularly to
a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself.

49
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,055
I see.

50
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:59,424
Then I'll just have to attack you.
I must have that oil.

51
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:05,330
Smithers. Smithers,
help me subdue this beast.

52
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,686
Sorry, sir. This was all I could find.
Take that. And that.

53
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,310
Please don't waste those.

54
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:16,746
I'm happy for the school.

55
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:19,666
Sounds like this money is gonna
provide new opportunities.

56
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:23,021
Big deal. They didn't approve my idea.
Said it was unfeasible.

57
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:25,337
It is unfeasible
to resurrect the dead, Bart.

58
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:28,961
And even if the Three Stooges were
alive, I doubt they'd hang out with you.

59
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:32,149
I guess they'd wanna be with
their families or something, huh?

60
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,894
Oh, I hate my job.

61
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,981
What's the point when your boss
doesn't even remember your name?

62
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,599
- I have an idea.
- What? What's your idea?

63
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,216
When my father was trying
to catch my mother's eye...

64
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,565
...he sent her a box of candy
with his photo.

65
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:47,552
- After that, she never forgot him.
- That's all well and good.

66
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:50,538
But it's not really your idea,
is it, now, Marge?

67
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:55,068
That's it. Frimble about with
your widgets and doobobs.

68
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:58,894
It will all be a monument to futility
when my plan comes to fruition.

69
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:00,438
Sir.

70
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:04,062
What I'm about to say violates
every sycophantic urge in my body...

71
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,048
...but I wish you'd reconsider.
This isn't a rival company...

72
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:10,102
...it's a school. They won't stand for it.
- Pishposh.

73
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,719
It will be like taking
candy from a baby.

74
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,867
Say, that sounds like a "larf."

75
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,015
Let's try it right now.

76
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,847
There's candy right here. Why
don't we eat this instead of stealing.

77
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:23,626
Oh, very well.

78
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:31,277
- Oh, look. There's a photo in here.
- Oh, yes.

79
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:35,941
That's little Maggie Simpson, the baby
who found my teddy bear Bobo.

80
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:39,397
And there's that Simpson mutt,
my former guard dog.

81
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,599
And that's Bart Simpson. He was my
heir for a brief period, you know.

82
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,746
Yes, sir. I remember.

83
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,579
Anything left?

84
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:54,330
Only the sour quince log, sir.

85
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:56,948
Dispose of it.

86
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:02,686
And send a thank-you note to
Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.

87
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:11,465
Today, Springfield Elementary
embarks on a new era of...

88
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:15,392
...unbridled spending where petrodollars
fuel our wildest educational fantasies.

89
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,582
These young minds will enjoy every
academic advantage...

90
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:23,173
...till they enter Springfield High School,
which has no oil well.

91
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:26,696
- We got an air hockey table.
- Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump...

92
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:31,025
...for the very first time, here's our
top student, Lisa Simpson.

93
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,267
Nerd!

94
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:40,857
There's no pressure.

95
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,146
- Someone else has tapped this well.
- Ay caramba!

96
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,508
Soon that mighty apparatus will
burst forth with its precious fluid.

97
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,925
Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?

98
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:04,683
Oil ho!

99
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,307
Huzzah!

100
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:36,753
Holy Christmas!

101
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,297
Your dog's condition has been
upgraded from stable to frisky.

102
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:46,451
He's free to go. His leg should
be good as new in a few months.

103
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,035
In the meantime,
he'll have to use the wheel-about.

104
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:53,599
I'll get even with whoever did this
to you, boy. I swear it.

105
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:57,156
I almost forgot. Wouldn't want
you gnawing on those casts, eh, boy?

106
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:04,841
We've got no legal recourse against
Mr. Burns' slant-drilling operation.

107
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:07,055
The oil belongs to whoever
pumped it first.

108
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,210
What about the expensive stuff
we wanted? Can we still have it?

109
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,854
No.

110
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,035
Blast it!

111
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:17,693
To pay for the construction, operation
and demolition of the derrick...

112
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:20,176
...we have to cut nonessential programs.
Music...

113
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,357
- What?!
- And maintenance.

114
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,284
I'll kill that Mr. Burns!

115
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:31,317
And wound that Mr. Smithers.
Out of my way.

116
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:33,968
Oh, no. That's awful, Mr. Puente.

117
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:35,914
What?

118
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:41,216
He owns the nuclear power plant.
Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash too.

119
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:43,700
Dad, how can you work
for a man like Mr. Burns?

120
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,586
He's not all bad. He did send me
this nice thank-you card.

121
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:50,847
"Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie."
Dad, this doesn't have your name on it.

122
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:57,525
Kids, would you
step outside for a second?

123
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:06,820
Dear Lord. That's the loudest
profanity I've ever heard.

124
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:13,331
These fumes aren't as fun as beer.
Sure, I'm all dizzy and nauseous...

125
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,586
...but where's the inflated sense
of self-esteem?

126
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:23,867
Hey, if you guys are getting loaded off
them fumes, I'll have to charge you.

127
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,820
Man alive!
There are men alive in here.

128
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:30,176
I'm detecting over
20 different toxins in the air.

129
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,579
Everybody out. As long as
Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed.

130
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,237
Damn Burns.
Let me just get one thing.

131
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:47,089
Me too. Now, there's the
inflated sense of self-esteem.

132
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:59,337
Earthquake!

133
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,418
- Nurse!
- Nurse! Nurse!

134
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:17,257
Well, sir, you've
vanquished all your enemies.

135
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:21,451
The elementary school, local tavern,
the old-age home. You must be proud.

136
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:25,042
No, not while my greatest nemesis still
provides our customers...

137
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,022
...with free light, heat and energy.

138
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:30,914
I call this enemy... the sun.

139
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,659
Since the beginning of time,
man has yearned to destroy the sun.

140
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,941
I will do the next best thing:

141
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,055
Block it out.

142
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:53,901
- Good God!
- Imagine it, Smithers.

143
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:56,988
Electrical lights and heaters
running all day long.

144
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:59,505
But, sir, every plant
and tree will die.

145
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:03,431
Owls will deafen us with incessant
hooting. The sundial will be useless.

146
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,002
I don't want any part of this project.
It's unconscionably fiendish.

147
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:10,646
I won't suffer your insubordination.

148
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:14,505
There has been a shocking decline in the
quality and quantity of your toadying.

149
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,485
And you will fall into line. Now!

150
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:19,673
No. No, Monty, I won't.

151
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:22,492
Not until you step back
from the brink of insanity.

152
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:25,948
I'll do no such thing. You're fired.

153
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:35,807
Take that, Bowl-a-rama.
Take that, convenience mart.

154
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:38,190
Take that, nuclear power pla...

155
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:40,069
Oh, fiddlesticks.

156
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:48,367
I must say, Mr. Burns is being
awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even.

157
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,522
Burns needs some serious
"boostafazoo." Right, Dad?

158
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:54,609
Dad. Homer.

159
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:59,978
Sorry, Grampa. It's just, for a second,
it looked like Dad had melted.

160
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:02,461
Well, get used to it,
because I'm living here now.

161
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,555
I ain't going back to the home until they
fish my bed out of that sinkhole.

162
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:09,810
Strained carrots for Maggie.
Strained carrots for Grampa.

163
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,522
I want a bib too.

164
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:15,951
Smithers, who is that ignoramus?
Smithers, who is that lollygagger?

165
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,334
Who is that blubber-pot?
Who is that bafflewit?

166
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:20,414
Lummox. Puddinghead.
Mooncalf. Limpnoodle.

167
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:21,857
Goldbricker. Drizzlepuss...

168
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,643
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
- Look out!

169
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:25,985
What?

170
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,817
Just a minute.

171
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:44,005
Who the devil are you?

172
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:49,005
- Homer Simpson.
- What? What are you talking about?

173
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,683
- Homer Simpson.
- Make sense, man.

174
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:54,978
- I can't understand a word you're saying.
- My name is Homer Simpson.

175
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,938
Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.
Oh, you're dead. You're dead, Burns!

176
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:03,468
- Hey, the lamp's running away.
- That's my dog, man.

177
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,965
So long, lamp. Now, stop loafing
and help your Grampa unpack.

178
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:12,797
That's my old Smith & Wesson.

179
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:15,582
If you're gonna play with it,
be careful. It's loaded.

180
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:17,327
Bart, put that down!

181
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:20,180
Guns are dangerous. And I won't
have them in this house.

182
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,067
How can you have a house
without a gun?

183
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:26,047
What if a bear came through the door?

184
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:30,645
I'm going to bury it in the yard
where little hands can't get to it.

185
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:33,497
You should've fired into the air.
She would've run off.

186
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,161
People, take it easy.

187
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:41,920
We're all upset about Mr. Burns'
plan to block out our sun.

188
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,537
It is time for decisive action.

189
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:48,195
I have here a polite but firm letter
to Mr. Burns' underlings...

190
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:51,685
...who, with some cajoling,
will pass it along to him...

191
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:53,833
...or at least
give him the gist of it.

192
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,745
Sir, a lot of people
are stroking guns.

193
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,135
It has been brought to my attention
a number of you are stroking guns.

194
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:01,517
Therefore I'll step aside
and open up the floor.

195
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:06,148
Mr. Burns was the closest thing
I ever had to a friend.

196
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:07,994
But he fired me.

197
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:11,886
And now I spend my days drinking cheap
Scotch and watching Comedy Central.

198
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:16,323
- Oh, dear God.
- I lost my bar. - I lost his bar.

199
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,114
He robbed the school of music.

200
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:21,369
- He robbed it of financial security.
- He robbed the school of Tito.

201
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:24,356
- He can't remember my name!
- He's causing us all to yell!

202
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,242
Look what he did to my best friend.

203
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,598
No, my dog.

204
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:40,296
Those wheels are squeaking a bit.

205
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:42,477
Perhaps I could sell him a little oil.

206
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,470
You twisted old monster!

207
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:51,739
I've decided to protect myself...

208
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,430
...ever since I was attacked in my office
by an unidentified assailant.

209
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:01,672
Burns, your scurvy schemes will earn ye
a one-way passage to the boneyard.

210
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:03,886
I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel.

211
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:09,994
I'll see that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal
machinations of hell's grim tyrant.

212
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,712
- Yeah.
- Oh, you all talk big.

213
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:16,302
But who here
has the guts to stop me?

214
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:24,054
Very well. One last question.

215
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:28,685
Have you ever seen
the sun set at 3 p. M?

216
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:32,607
Once, when I was
sailing around the Arctic...

217
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:37,171
Shut up, you. Take one last look
at the sun, Springfield.

218
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:58,849
Hey, hey!

219
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,876
I've been in Reno for six weeks.
Did I miss anything?

220
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:04,084
What the...?

221
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:10,157
Eternal darkness.
Well, that's just great.

222
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,506
Listen, someone's
got to get that Mr. Burns.

223
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,225
Where's a gun-toting lowlife
when you need one?

224
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:17,238
Sorry, I was in the can.

225
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:25,761
Perpetual twilight. Bathed in
the glow of Burns brand electricity.

226
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:29,553
Hello, lamppost. What you knowing?

227
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:33,110
I've come to watch
your power flowing.

228
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:38,211
That's odd. Mr. Smithers
left his jacket behind.

229
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:44,318
That's odd. Principal Skinner
left his mother behind.

230
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:54,822
That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart?
And Lisa? And Grampa?

231
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:04,151
After all these years, things are
finally starting to go my way.

232
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:06,500
I feel like celebrating.

233
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,822
Oh, it's you.
What are you so happy about?

234
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:13,379
I see. I think you'd better drop it.

235
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:16,030
I said, drop it!

236
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,332
Get your hands off.

237
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,580
Where is everybody?

238
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:31,359
Hey, man. Are you okay?

239
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:36,661
Won't... dignify that... with a response.

240
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,459
Mr. Burns has been shot.

241
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:44,882
Just a minute.
This isn't Mr. Burns at all.

242
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,392
It's a mask.

243
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:51,560
Oh, wait, it is Burns.

244
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:53,808
His wrinkly skin looks like a mask.

245
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,439
I don't think we'll ever know who
did this. Everyone in town's a suspect.

246
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:08,976
Well, I couldn't possibly
solve this mystery.

247
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:11,761
Can you?

248
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:16,963
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.
I mean, you know, it's my job, right?
