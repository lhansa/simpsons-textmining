1
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:04,617
Lemon of Troy

2
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,027
"Wet cement."

3
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:39,483
Is there any sweeter sign?
Well, maybe "high voltage."

4
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:47,705
Hello, son. You want to try
this flying motorcycle I just invented?

5
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,953
- No time.
- Okay.

6
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,953
This is for the ages.

7
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,550
Like Stonehenge,
this site will forever be a mystery.

8
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,436
Who was Bart?

9
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,423
And how did he manage
to write his name in solid cement?

10
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:09,181
He must've been smarter than his sister
Lisa, about whom we know nothing.

11
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:12,000
Say, let's bring him back to life
by using technology.

12
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,416
Ay caramba!

13
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:25,221
- What's normal to him amazes us.
- He will be our new god.

14
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,819
Good, somebody's shadow.
I'll just turn and brag about my work.

15
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:39,081
Bart, you've graffito-tagged
public property.

16
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:40,960
It was an accident.

17
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:44,013
I can't believe you vandalized
your own hometown, Bart.

18
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:47,101
- What would Jebediah Springfield say?
- He'd be cool with it.

19
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:50,154
Homer, will you please help me
make a big deal of this?

20
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:54,215
What for? Nobody cared when Bogart
defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.

21
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,034
Well, I'm just shocked
by this whole family.

22
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,685
Whatever happened
to good old-fashioned town pride?

23
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,235
It's been going down
since the lake caught fire.

24
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:06,698
Now, just a darn minute.
This town is a part of who you are.

25
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:09,852
This is a Springfield Isotopes cap.

26
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,940
When you wear it,
you're wearing Springfield.

27
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,664
When you eat a fish from our river,
you're eating Springfield.

28
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:21,631
When you make lemonade from
our trees, you're drinking Springfield.

29
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,785
Mom, when you give that lecture,
you're boring Springfield.

30
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:27,772
You have roots in this town,
and you ought to show respect.

31
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,383
This town is a part of us all.

32
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,966
A part of us all. A part of us all.

33
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,685
Sorry to repeat myself,
but it'll help you remember.

34
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:38,175
This town is a part of us all.

35
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,691
A part of us all. A part of us all.

36
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,705
Wow, that does work.

37
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:51,785
When it comes to catching trout,
nothing beats the German light infantry.

38
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:53,228
Beautiful, aren't they?

39
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:56,617
Yep. I'm gonna huck them at cars.

40
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,530
Hey, Milhouse.
How's the lemonade business?

41
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:06,383
It's clearly booming, Bart.

42
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:10,443
I don't even want any.
I just bought a pity glass.

43
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:14,168
We've squozen our whole supply.
To the lemon tree!

44
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:27,154
Thar she grows.

45
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:33,631
You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking.
This town ain't so bad.

46
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,121
Good friends, lots of lemons,
numerous angel sightings.

47
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:41,081
When you get right down to it,
Springfield's a pretty cool place to live.

48
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:43,161
Springfield sucks.

49
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,987
Hey, stop talking bad
about my town, man.

50
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,705
- Why don't you make me.
- I don't make trash, I burn it.

51
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:53,128
- Then I guess you're a garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?

52
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,812
- A garbage man.
- Oh, I know you are, but what am I?

53
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,497
- A garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?

54
00:03:58,732 --> 00:04:00,846
- A garbage man.
- Takes one to know one.

55
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:03,732
- Checkmate.
- Hey, kid.

56
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,980
Stop wearing your backpack
over one shoulder.

57
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:09,906
- We invented that. Copycat.
- You copied us.

58
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:13,362
Step over this line and say that.
I'll kick your butt...

59
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,805
...at Nintendo.

60
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,027
I just put a rock in your crummy town.

61
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:21,315
That's a crud rock.
It belongs in Crudtown.

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,242
Look at the weak little baby.
You're stupid, you stupid, weak baby.

63
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,664
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Hey, they're taking our lemons.

64
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,644
We can't spare a single one.

65
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:42,993
You just got citric acid in my eye.

66
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,946
You'll pay for that, Springfield.

67
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,208
Some things never change.

68
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:52,557
Hey, everybody, an old man's talking.

69
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,785
Grampa's the name.

70
00:04:56,987 --> 00:05:01,416
Did you know this tree dates
back to frontier times?

71
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,242
Shut up!

72
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:10,606
It all began when Jebediah Springfield
first came to these lands...

73
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:15,002
...with his partner,
Shelbyville Manhattan.

74
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,781
People, our search is over.

75
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:25,338
On this site, we shall build a new town,
where we can worship freely...

76
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:29,666
...govern justly and grow vast fields
of hemp for making rope and blankets.

77
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,955
- Yes, and marry our cousins.
- I was...

78
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:36,747
What are you talking about, Shelbyville?
Why would we marry our cousins?

79
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:38,425
Because they're so attractive.

80
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,908
I thought that was
the whole point of this journey.

81
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:42,687
- Absolutely not.
- I tell you...

82
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:46,411
...I won't live in a town that robs men
of the right to marry their cousins.

83
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,895
Well, then we'll form our own town.

84
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:52,787
Who will come and live a life devoted
to chastity, abstinence...

85
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:55,707
...and a flavorless mush
I call rootmarm?

86
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:08,660
The town of Springfield
was born on that day.

87
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,928
And to mark that sweet moment,
our people planted this lemon tree...

88
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:17,452
...lemons being the sweetest fruit
available at the time.

89
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:24,801
Those Shelbyville kids think they're hot.
You know what? They're not.

90
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:28,123
- I really agree with you on this one, Bart.
- Class, please.

91
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:29,968
If you don't learn Roman numerals...

92
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,418
...you'll never know
when movies were copyrighted.

93
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,371
Come quick. Something's happened.
No time to explain.

94
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:37,619
No, children. No.

95
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:41,445
Your education is important.
Roman numerals, et cetera.

96
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,895
Whatever. I tried.

97
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,935
Are you sure it wouldn't be faster
to just tell us what happened?

98
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:54,130
No. I said there's no time to explain,
and I stick by that.

99
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:57,787
The lemon tree's gone.

100
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,841
And the tracks appear to lead
into Shelbyville.

101
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:03,526
Oh, look, a clue. A candy-bar wrapper.

102
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:06,713
Oh, they're always eating candy
in Shelbyville.

103
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:10,237
- They love the sweet taste.
- We gotta get that tree back.

104
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,964
You mean going to Shelbyville?
We'll never make it out alive.

105
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:19,460
That lemon tree's part of our town and,
as kids, the backbone of our economy.

106
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:22,984
We'll get it back
or choke their rivers with our dead.

107
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:28,046
Hey, Milhouse,
get your invasion supplies, and let's go.

108
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:34,926
Get him. Come on.

109
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:40,530
- Where did he go?
- Over here, my friends.

110
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,919
Or is it over here?

111
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:48,315
Yeah.

112
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,013
Here's how it goes. I'm the leader.
Milhouse is my loyal sidekick.

113
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,295
Nelson's the tough guy.
Martin's the smart guy.

114
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:57,711
Todd's the religious guy
who ends up going crazy.

115
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,053
And now...

116
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:03,113
...the time has come to cross this line
into mystery and danger.

117
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:06,771
To step out of childhood
and become men.

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,201
If you get lost, remember...

119
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:25,395
...you can always find east
by staring directly at the sun.

120
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:28,181
Here's a tip.
Put a pinch of sage in your boots...

121
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:31,972
...and all day long,
a spicy scent is your reward.

122
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:34,926
Oh, my gosh. Look.

123
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:37,543
The fire hydrants here are yellow.

124
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:40,026
This place is starting to freak me out.

125
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,516
Danger coming. Behind us.

126
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,214
What is it, boy? Is there something
behind that wall we should beat up?

127
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:52,409
No time to check it out now.
We've got lemonade to sell.

128
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,630
Radical.

129
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,979
They're getting rich off us.

130
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:00,261
And that kid with the backpack
said "radical."

131
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:03,818
I say "radical."
That's my thing that I say.

132
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:06,972
I feel like I'm gonna explode here.

133
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:12,207
It's lunchtime. Do you know
where your brother's tutoring?

134
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:16,670
Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching
is guerrilla combat in Shelbyville.

135
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:19,288
- You have a number we can reach him?
- No, Mom.

136
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:22,241
Bart and some kids ran off
to wage war on Shelbyville.

137
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:25,462
Homer, come quick.

138
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,516
Bart's quit his tutoring job
and joined a violence gang.

139
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,546
The trail has become indistinct.

140
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:36,734
I suggest we split up
to cover more ground.

141
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,519
Good idea. Milhouse,
you and me will be Omega Team.

142
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:42,069
Todd, you and Data
are Team Strike Force.

143
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,633
- Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.
- Team Discovery Channel.

144
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:50,492
Your wussiness better come in handy.

145
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:55,794
- What's going on?
- I want some answers.

146
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,982
Okay, folks, look,
I called the police captain in Shelbyville.

147
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:00,626
He says he hasn't seen our kids.

148
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:03,177
But if they show up in the morgue,
he's gonna fax us.

149
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:07,740
- Oh, man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks.
- Honey, I was born in Shelbyville.

150
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,720
And it tears me up inside.

151
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:13,109
This is my fault.
I tried to teach Bart about town pride.

152
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:16,264
But the power of my words
filled him with a sort of madness.

153
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:21,398
Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's
problems on your one little speech.

154
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,143
If anything turned him bad...

155
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:26,532
...it's that time you let him wear
a bathing suit instead of underwear.

156
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,297
- And let's not forget your little speech.
- Isn't there anything we can do?

157
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,982
Yes, there is. Come on, everybody.

158
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,740
Let's go into Shelbyville
and get those kids back ourselves.

159
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:39,586
I got an RV we can use.

160
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:41,499
- Flanders'.
- Yeah!

161
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,888
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay, but just go a little bit easy on it.

162
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,103
Pile in, everybody.
No time to wipe your feet.

163
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:48,277
Come on.

164
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,646
Okay, piglet, start squealing.

165
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:56,062
Where'd you get the lemons
for this lemonade?

166
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,759
This is Country Time Lemonade Mix.

167
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:01,981
There's never been anything
close to a lemon in it. I swear.

168
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,766
Hey. Nobody hassles
my little brother.

169
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:08,759
Hey. And no one manhandles
the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz.

170
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,048
Spring forth, burly protector,
and save me.

171
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,316
Jeez.

172
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:20,639
I never hang out with him, normally.

173
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,471
Hark to the tale of Nelson
And the boy he loved so dear

174
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:29,531
They remained the best of friends
For years and years and years

175
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:32,384
- What are they saying?
- I'm not sure.

176
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:35,471
- I thought you said you could read lips.
- I assumed I could.

177
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:37,014
It's no use, Milhouse.

178
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:40,102
If we're gonna find that lemon tree,
I've got to go undercover.

179
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:43,625
- What I need is a new face.
- You leave that to the baron and me.

180
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:49,800
Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.

181
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,276
Wait a minute.

182
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,733
If you're from Shelbyville, how come
we've never seen you at school?

183
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,323
- I don't go to school.
- Okay, what's two plus two?

184
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,303
- Five.
- Story checks out.

185
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:03,692
We just got word
there's Springfield kids in town.

186
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:06,578
Curse those handsome devils.

187
00:12:06,746 --> 00:12:10,169
We're going up to the bluffs to paint
"Springfield sucks" in huge letters.

188
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:14,028
That way, whenever they look into
Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck.

189
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:17,686
- Radical.
- Quit copying me.

190
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:22,115
You know, I wish there was
a Springfield kid here right now.

191
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,598
I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.

192
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,343
No, not in my mouth...

193
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:29,565
...is what the kid would say.
To the bluffs.

194
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,867
Well, a friendly Springfield hello
there, neighbors.

195
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:38,424
You know, we think some kids of ours
may be missing in your town.

196
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,934
Missing children?

197
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:42,618
Sounds like Springfield's
got a discipline problem.

198
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,108
Maybe that's why we beat them
at football nearly half the time, huh?

199
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:51,947
Quit stalling, kid.
Write "Springfield sucks" in giant letters.

200
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,055
His can control is excellent.

201
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:07,384
Yes. And that wig makes him look
a lot like one of the Beatles.

202
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:14,895
That's right, the stranger who walks
amongst you is me, Bart Simpson.

203
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:17,848
You know, Bart Simpson.

204
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:22,479
- From Springfield?
- He's from Springfield. Get him!

205
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:35,878
I'll use these spray cans
as jetpacks and fly to safety.

206
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,127
So long, losers.

207
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,569
You're dead.

208
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,751
Hey, look.
Someone's attractive cousin.

209
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:49,536
- Where? Where?
- I don't see anybody.

210
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:56,885
So he thinks he can
out-skateboard me, huh?

211
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,838
Launch me, boys.

212
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:26,684
Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing
cube-gleamers.

213
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:35,073
"Wet cement."

214
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:42,959
I could sure use
that flying motorcycle now.

215
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:45,274
You had your chance.

216
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:58,160
Safe at last.

217
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,053
"Caution: Exit through door seven only.

218
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,744
All other rooms contain
man-eating tigers."

219
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:16,382
Roman numerals. They never even tried
to teach us that in school.

220
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,543
Milhouse, what's seven
in Roman numerals?

221
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:24,771
I'll tell you, but you really should end
each transmission with the word "over."

222
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:26,784
- Over.
- Correction:

223
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:29,872
The only thing that's over
is that transmission.

224
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,556
Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?

225
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:37,288
- But Milhouse is my name.
- But I thought I was the only one.

226
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:39,603
A pain I know all too well.

227
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:44,704
So this is what it feels like
when doves cry.

228
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:47,187
Milhouse. Milhouse.
Now what do I do?

229
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,106
Wait. I got it.

230
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:51,751
I got it.

231
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,167
I don't got it. Okay, think, Bart.

232
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:56,885
Where have you seen
Roman numerals before?

233
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,637
I know. Rocky V.
That was the fifth one.

234
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:05,610
So Rocky V plus Rocky II
equals Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge!

235
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,301
Come back here.

236
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,972
It's no use.
I'm never gonna find that tree.

237
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,924
This whole raid was as useless as that
yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there.

238
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:22,366
Wait a minute.

239
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:24,615
There's a lemon behind that rock.

240
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:27,534
The tree!

241
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:40,085
A car impound lot.

242
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:43,071
The impenetrable fortress of suburbia.

243
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:46,561
- We'll never get the tree back now.
- Keep your voices down, boys.

244
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:50,722
- We didn't get this far to get found out.
- Found them! You kids are in big trouble.

245
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,977
- Running away from home like this.
- But they stole our lemon tree.

246
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,595
I don't care what excuse you've got.

247
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:59,380
Nothing's gonna stop me
in the middle of this speech.

248
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:01,226
You're gonna... Lemon tree?

249
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:06,091
That tree's been in Springfield
since the time of our forefathers.

250
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,615
Give it back,
or we'll bust in there and take it.

251
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,494
Bust in here and take it?

252
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:15,722
- You must stupider than you look.
- Stupider like a fox!

253
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,977
I'm okay.

254
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,823
Don't you get it, Springfield?
It's over. You lose.

255
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:35,219
Now, if you'll excuse me,
all this talk has made me hungry.

256
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,051
This is the darkest day
in the history of Springfield.

257
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,668
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in the shower.

258
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,957
There's got to be a way
to get that tree back.

259
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,373
Hey, look. A hospital.

260
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:54,984
Pull in there.

261
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,944
Oh, great. Now I'm upside down.

262
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,177
Oh, dear, some thoughtless human being
has parked in a hospital zone.

263
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:28,586
No one in history
has ever done anything this clever.

264
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,486
I'll get the gate.

265
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:39,929
That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.

266
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:45,801
Faster, son!
He's got a taste for meat now.

267
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,405
Get out here, son.
There's a-doings a-transpiring.

268
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:59,325
Let's shut the gate and seal them in.

269
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:01,539
Gun it, Flanders.

270
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,197
It won't start.
Something's draining the battery.

271
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:07,378
Sorry.

272
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,224
We made it.

273
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,210
Eat my shorts, Shelbyville.

274
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,425
- Eat my shorts.
- Eat my shorts.

275
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,674
Yes, eat all of our shirts.

276
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,090
Oh, you lousy Springfielders, you...

277
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:26,472
Shake harder, boy.

278
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:30,130
We did it!

279
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,418
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

280
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:42,378
And with that, a mighty cheer went up
from the heroes of Springfield.

281
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,667
They had brought the sacred tree
back to its native soil.

282
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,653
And though Flanders was stuck
with the impound fee...

283
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,707
...he could easily afford it.

284
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:55,734
- More lemonade, Bart?
- Absolutely.

285
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:57,378
Say when.

286
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:01,271
There are over 14 parts
of the lemon that are...

287
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:05,566
And with that, a mighty cheer went up
from the heroes of Shelbyville.

288
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:08,586
They had banished
the awful lemon tree forever...

289
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,566
...because it was haunted.

290
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,345
Now, let's all celebrate...

291
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:16,103
...with a cool glass of turnip juice.
