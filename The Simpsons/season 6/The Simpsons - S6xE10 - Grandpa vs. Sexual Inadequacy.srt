1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,286
Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy

2
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:32,606
We now return to the 1971 film...

3
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:36,885
...Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie,
and the Great Frisco FreakOut...

4
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:38,486
...starring Troy McClure.

5
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:44,252
Slim, if we've got the bag
with the stolen diamonds...

6
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:46,643
...then what happened to the bag
with our stash?

7
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,122
There's more than one way
to get high, baby.

8
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,772
Please, Marge. How often
can I see a movie of this caliber...

9
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:03,527
...on late night TV?
- Is there something wrong, Homie?

10
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:06,042
It's just that I've only seen this
twice before...

11
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,727
...and I've seen you every night
for the last 11 ye...

12
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:11,487
What I meant to say is,
we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie.

13
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:13,052
I promise.

14
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,290
Enchiladas.

15
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:29,922
Mom! Dad!

16
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,010
Don't turn on the light!

17
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:35,125
There's a UFO outside my window.
Seriously.

18
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,962
Oh, Bart, it's just an old golf umbrella
stuck in a tree.

19
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:43,012
Can I sleep in there
with you guys tonight?

20
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:44,532
- No.
- Can I sit on the roof...

21
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:46,331
...with a baseball bat
in case a UFO comes?

22
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,012
Yes, that's fine. Good, good.

23
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,561
I hope you kept
the Homie fires burning.

24
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:58,450
- Homer! Homer, wake up. Wake up.
- What?

25
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:03,090
We need to talk about the marital
difficulties we've been having lately.

26
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:05,045
Marge, there's just too much pressure.

27
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:07,249
What with my job, the kids,
traffic snarls...

28
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,210
...political strife at home and abroad.

29
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:14,401
But I promise you the second all those
things go away, we'll have sex.

30
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,929
I simply can't wait that long.
Maybe we should get some help.

31
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,129
- How about a book?
- Okay.

32
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,766
A tasteful book.

33
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:23,725
Oh, all right.

34
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:39,968
Hey, Marge, this guy looks like Apu!

35
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,126
I don't want people to see us
looking at these books.

36
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:45,641
What you looking at?

37
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:47,966
I'm just reading up on artillery.

38
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,563
Yes, and I'm pursuing my interest in...

39
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:55,089
This one's a good choice
and it's not smutty.

40
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:56,891
It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey.

41
00:02:57,053 --> 00:03:00,568
That Midwestern man on the radio
who's like a pleasant version of Grampa.

42
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:04,527
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American.

43
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,007
Mom, Dad, look!

44
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:08,687
This biography of Peter Uebberoth
is only 99 cents.

45
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,971
- And I found the new Al Gore book.
- Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow.

46
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,124
I hope it's as exciting
as his other book:

47
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,090
Rational Thinking,
Reasonable Future.

48
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:18,652
I'm getting this book on UFOs.

49
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,247
Did you know they're real?

50
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,244
But there's a conspiracy
to cover it up.

51
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,564
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.

52
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:48,165
Mr. Vice President, someone finally
bought a copy of your book.

53
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,762
Well, this calls for a celebration.

54
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:54,887
Celebrate good times
Come on!

55
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,811
I will.

56
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,768
Hello, Americans. Paul Harvey here.

57
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:05,450
Did you know every good American
is at heart an erotic American?

58
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,171
It's true.

59
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,607
A famous couple...

60
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:11,685
I don 't need to tell you it was
Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.

61
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,809
- Offered this advice:

62
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:16,004
"Double your pleasure with a bath...

63
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,162
...together."

64
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:23,285
Homie, I can't quite fit.

65
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,808
The faucet's jammed into my back.

66
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,247
I'm stuck.

67
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,247
So am I.

68
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:37,131
- Kids?
- Kids?

69
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:38,851
- Kids?
- Kids?

70
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:42,526
A romantic vacation
can provide titillation.

71
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,123
Sensual, sanitary seclusion
awaits you at any of America 's fine...

72
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,932
...AAA-approved motor lodges.

73
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,405
The Arabian Nights Room looks nice.

74
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:58,651
The Pharaoh's Chamber
has a vibrating sarcophagus.

75
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:01,771
Sorry there, Fred and Ethel.
Should have made a reservation.

76
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,128
We only got one room left.

77
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,972
The toilet is overflowing
in the Caveman Room.

78
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:15,130
Oh, here we are. The Utility Room.

79
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,531
This isn't very erotic.
I think it's an actual utility room.

80
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:26,802
No, honey. It's a romantic fantasy.
I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're...

81
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:31,609
...the janitor's wife, who has to
live with me in the utility room.

82
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:39,483
Don't mind me, folks.
Just need to get the old wet-dry vac.

83
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:45,885
By now, your new improved love life
should have you flinging woo...

84
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,691
...like nobody's business.

85
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:52,244
So to you,
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American, I bid...

86
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:54,404
...good day.

87
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,252
Welcome home, son. I broke two lamps
and lost all your mail.

88
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:06,206
- What's wrong with your wife?
- You wouldn't understand.

89
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:07,362
- Flu?
- No.

90
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,852
- Protein deficiency?
- No.

91
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:12,369
Pneumonoultramicroscopic-
silicovolcanoconiosis?

92
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,524
- No.
- Unsatisfying sex life?

93
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:18,288
N... Yes! But please,
don't you say that word.

94
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,882
What? Sex?

95
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:23,726
What's so unappealing
about hearing your elderly father...

96
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:25,246
...talk about sex?

97
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:28,086
I had sex.

98
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,130
You're home safe. See you
the next time we need your signature.

99
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,483
Oh, you never wanna spend
any time with me.

100
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:41,292
But I can help you
with your loving problem.

101
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:45,605
I got a home remedy that'll put
the dowsers back in your trousers.

102
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,642
Legend has it my great grandpappy
stumbled upon this recipe...

103
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,965
...when he was trying to invent
a cheap substitute for holy water.

104
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:04,811
Here you g... Hey!

105
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,007
Here you go, you ingrate!

106
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:10,483
Think of me when you're having
the best sex of your life.

107
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:13,685
Drink it!

108
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:26,406
Here's $50. Go to the movies,
then take a cab to your aunt's.

109
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:28,529
Stay there. Call you later.
Now, now, now.

110
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:32,850
- Homie, what's...?
- Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.

111
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,890
What do you think Mom and Dad
are doing?

112
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:45,327
I don't know.

113
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:59,164
Here he is, Rex Harrison
and Paul Anka rolled into one.

114
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:02,491
That tonic really works.

115
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:05,486
You and Grampa should bottle it
and go into business together.

116
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,684
You want me to spend
more time with Dad?

117
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,650
What about my New Year's resolution?

118
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:11,491
You can make a lot of money.

119
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,843
Yeah. Where are my pants?

120
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:15,526
You threw them out the window.

121
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,570
You said you'd never
need them again.

122
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:19,968
Oh, hurry, Neddie. They're awful.

123
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,529
You just be ready
with that garbage bag.

124
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:26,601
Oh, mama!

125
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:28,371
This is finally really happening.

126
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,525
After years of disappointment
with get-rich-quick schemes...

127
00:08:31,693 --> 00:08:33,923
...I know I'm gonna get rich
with this scheme.

128
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,128
And quick.

129
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:41,204
Sir? Hello, sir. Yes.

130
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:44,888
You look like a man who needs help
satisfying his wife. So...

131
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:49,404
I guess people have some sort
of moral objection to our sex drug.

132
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:51,211
Let me sell it, you idiot.

133
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:56,290
Step right up and witness
the magnificent medicinal miracle...

134
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,731
...of Simpson & Son's
patented Revitalizing Tonic!

135
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:04,005
Put some ardor in your larder
with our energizing, moisturizing...

136
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:10,812
...tantalizing, romanticizing, surprising,
"her-prising," revitalizing tonic!

137
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:19,923
I doubt very highly that one elixir can
boast so many fantastic properties.

138
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:24,884
What say we amscray out
of here and have a wild wingding...

139
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:26,406
...at the cyclotron, doctor.

140
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:29,610
Anything you say, professor.

141
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,241
Tonight, we'll push
the twin beds together.

142
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:38,088
And I found something for Milhouse
down at the mall too. A pup tent.

143
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:41,086
Oh, boy!
Now I can sleep out in the yard!

144
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:42,931
Yeah! Every single night.

145
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:47,928
I've discovered that
the rejuvenating effect...

146
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,004
...is actually a mild form of poisoning.

147
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,403
No doubt a result
of the unsanitary conditions...

148
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,131
...in Grampa Simpson's bathtub.

149
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,090
Nonetheless...

150
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,322
What's going on?
Where are all the grownups?

151
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:12,009
Who cares?
With no adults around, I run this city.

152
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:16,323
Carry on.

153
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,603
Listen to this.
"Unexplainable behavior.

154
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:21,128
Individuals acting
in a secretive fashion...

155
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:25,809
...are often involved with UFOs
or other paranormal phenomena...

156
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,043
...e.g. Telephone explosions."

157
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,404
Jeez! If it's in a book,
it's gotta be true.

158
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:35,572
Scary, no? And this guy is head
of the Spaceology Department...

159
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,923
...at the Correspondence College
of Tampa.

160
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:40,004
Will you cook my dinner for me?

161
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,961
My parents aren't around and
I'm not allowed to turn on the stove.

162
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:49,332
Hurry up. We got a lot of tonic to sell
and a lot of towns to visit.

163
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,809
Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom,
Lake Flaccid.

164
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:56,488
Great. I'm gonna be stuck in a car
all weekend with that wheezy windbag.

165
00:10:58,573 --> 00:10:59,972
And that's what's wrong
with Bart's generation.

166
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,612
Now as for your generation...

167
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,689
And for the minimal outlay
of one dollar...

168
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:08,242
...you can take home a bottle
of liquid Lothario...

169
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:12,292
...distilled Don Juan,
catalytically carbonated Casanova.

170
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:16,088
Lock old Rover in the shed,
because man has a new best friend...

171
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:19,086
...in Simpson & Son's
Revitalizing Tonic.

172
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:22,365
I'm not convinced.
I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs.

173
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:26,088
All questions will be answered,
all fears will be allayed...

174
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,562
...with one incontrovertible
demonstration.

175
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,293
May I have a volunteer
from the audience?

176
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:33,404
Yes, you, sir.

177
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:35,963
You've never seen me before,
is that correct?

178
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:37,407
That is correct.

179
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,212
Well, then how come his face
is on the bottle?

180
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:50,687
You're the worst shill ever!

181
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:53,048
You're a disgrace
to the medicine show business.

182
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,285
They didn't start chasing us until
you turned on that getaway music.

183
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,727
Okay. It's now painfully clear.

184
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:20,250
The adults are definitely paving the way
for an invasion by the saucer people.

185
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:23,684
You fool. Can't you see
it's a massive government conspiracy?

186
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:26,726
Or have they gotten to you too?

187
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,807
Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it!

188
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:33,533
Why are you guys jumping
to such ridiculous conclusions?

189
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,530
Haven't you ever heard
of Ockham's razor?

190
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:38,287
The simplest explanation
is probably the correct one.

191
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:40,961
- So, what's the simplest explanation?
- I don't know.

192
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:44,887
Maybe they're all reverse vampires
and they have to get home before dark.

193
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:51,691
- Reverse vampires!
- Vampires! The undead!

194
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:55,847
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Amos Pierson's moose farm.

195
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,685
Make a right here.

196
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,091
Why are we stopping at this dump?

197
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:07,490
That's the house you grew up in, son.

198
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:12,082
Let's go find
that hot dog tree I planted.

199
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:16,127
Yeah, we lived here
till the bank foreclosed in '63.

200
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,928
Farm went bust after the cows
started giving sour milk.

201
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:23,449
Something must've
spooked them good.

202
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,045
Stupid cows!

203
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:40,370
Oh, memories.
If this old place could talk, it'd say...

204
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,291
There she is. The old Radiation King.

205
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:59,362
You'd park yourself right there
and watch for hours on end.

206
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:04,686
If I may, Helen,
I'd like to respond to that question...

207
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,447
...with yet another flip remark.

208
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,565
Look at me, Mom.
I am President Kennedy.

209
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:20,282
Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer
could grow up to be president someday.

210
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:24,844
You, president?
This is the greatest country in the world.

211
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:27,402
We've got a system set up
to keep people like you...

212
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,052
...from ever becoming president.

213
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,284
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.

214
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:34,962
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.

215
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:38,205
Dad, how come you never gave me
any encouragement?

216
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:40,967
Maybe I could've been
something more than I am.

217
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,447
Like a travel agent...

218
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,012
...to a great scientist.

219
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:47,006
Or the inventor
of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.

220
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:49,687
Who are you to complain?
You lock me up in a home...

221
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:53,124
...and give me the same damn
shower safety seat every Christmas.

222
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:57,052
Your whole life,
you never said one nice thing to me.

223
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,283
That's because you're a screwup.

224
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:02,371
- You're the screwup!
- Why, you little...

225
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:04,527
All right.

226
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,888
All right, that's it.
We're going home.

227
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:08,964
I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic.

228
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:11,488
If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic
38 years ago...

229
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:14,121
...you'd have never been born
and I'd have been happy.

230
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,051
You were an accident!

231
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,567
Get out.

232
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,122
- I'm sorry I said that.
- Out.

233
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,409
I'm gonna get out of the car.

234
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:28,009
And I hope you'll find it in your heart
not to drive awa...

235
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:35,804
Well, I'll be all right as long
as I can remember my Army training.

236
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,849
Dang.

237
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,642
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:51,844
Hi?

239
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:56,124
Homie, are you really going to
ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?

240
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:59,012
Of course not, Marge.
Just for the rest of his life.

241
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:01,562
He said I was an accident.
He didn't wanna have me.

242
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,007
You didn't wanna have Bart.

243
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:05,084
You're never supposed
to tell the child.

244
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,045
You tell Bart all the time.

245
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:08,891
But when I do it, it's cute.

246
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:13,292
So finally, we're all in agreement
about what's going on with the adults.

247
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:16,843
- Milhouse.
- Okay, here's what we've got.

248
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:18,532
The Rand Corporation...

249
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:22,049
...in conjunction with the saucer people...
- Thank you.

250
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,283
...under the supervision
of the reverse vampires...

251
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,048
...are forcing our parents
to go to bed early...

252
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:32,489
...in a fiendish plot
to eliminate the meal of dinner.

253
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:35,851
We're through
the looking glass here, people.

254
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:39,648
Kids, your daddy and his daddy
are involved in a very sticky...

255
00:16:39,813 --> 00:16:44,489
...nutty, chewy, chocolatey...
Put it away, boy! ...situation.

256
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:47,372
And your daddy has realized
something very important.

257
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,565
A father should always make
his kids feel wanted.

258
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:53,207
Starting now, I promise to spend
more time with you...

259
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:56,126
...and give you the attention
you deserve.

260
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:58,923
I can't breathe.

261
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,327
And feast your ears
on this tantalizing testimonial...

262
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:04,245
...from my own flesh and blood.

263
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:07,325
The son who puts the fun
in Simpson & Son...

264
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,882
...my son, Barney.

265
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:14,325
I used to be a fat, disgusting slob.

266
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,525
That medicine seems to be
giving your son a lot of gas.

267
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:22,602
I assure you his belching is the result
of an unrelated alcohol problem.

268
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,847
It just ain't the same without Homer.

269
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:33,291
He knew how to drive a car.

270
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,281
Son. My dear son.

271
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:42,251
From now on, I'm going to be
a good and attentive father.

272
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:45,684
And for starters, your old man
is gonna teach you how to ride...

273
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:48,651
...your very first bike.

274
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,647
Dad, number one:
I know how to ride a bike.

275
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:01,489
Number two: I already own a bike.
And number three: That is a girl's bike.

276
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:06,568
You're no girl, you're a boy.
A good boy. You can be president.

277
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,327
- Scratch that. You will be president!
- Dad!

278
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:13,209
I think Lisa needs another push
on her new tire swing.

279
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,327
No, Dad. I wanna get down.

280
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:19,809
This tire is filthy
and the steel belts are poking me.

281
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,766
No! No!

282
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:26,170
No offense, but your half-assed
under-parenting was a lot more fun...

283
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,210
...than your half-assed over-parenting.

284
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:30,165
But I'm using my whole ass.

285
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:33,763
Dad, it's just that too much
of your love can really be...

286
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,607
...scary.

287
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:40,492
Someday you'll thank me
for all this scary love.

288
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:44,491
But now I've gotta go somewhere
and do some serious thinking.

289
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:50,846
- I'm sure he meant to say "drinking."
- That's what I assumed.

290
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:56,607
Here's where it all started
to go wrong.

291
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:00,647
How am I supposed to be a good dad
when I never had one myself?

292
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,922
Oh, Dad wasn't even around
on Christmas morning...

293
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,732
...when I actually got to meet
Santa Claus.

294
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:09,849
Some father.

295
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,287
Wait a minute...

296
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:13,566
Dad!

297
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,969
This photo is a blessing.

298
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,885
It eases my pain.

299
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:30,092
This tonic's caused me nothing
but trouble.

300
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,165
You've done all the damage
you're gonna do.

301
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,323
Oh, nuts!

302
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:44,570
- Dad!
- Son!

303
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:47,810
I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.

304
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:51,449
No. I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.

305
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:53,530
- You know what?
- What?

306
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,805
- We're both screwups.
- It doesn't matter.

307
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:59,851
What matters is you were right
when you told me...

308
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:03,483
...I never said anything nice about you.

309
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:06,969
So are you gonna say
something nice now?

310
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,811
I hadn't thought that far ahead.

311
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,892
Okay, here it goes.

312
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:16,648
I'm not sorry I had you, son.

313
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,205
And I was always proud...

314
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:22,762
...that you weren't a short man.

315
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,332
Oh, Dad.

316
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,923
What do you say
we roll on the grass, son?

317
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,527
I'm with you, Dad.
