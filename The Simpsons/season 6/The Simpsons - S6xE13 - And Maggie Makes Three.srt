1
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:05,621
And Maggie Makes Three

2
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:33,038
We now return to
Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat.

3
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,655
Faster, Knightboat.
Gotta catch those starfish poachers.

4
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:38,105
Don't have to yell, Michael.
I'm all around you.

5
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:41,192
Oh, no. They're headed for land.

6
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:48,239
- We'll never catch them now.
- Incorrect. Look, a canal.

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,528
- Go, Knightboat, go.
- Every week, there's a canal.

8
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:53,709
- Or an inlet.
- Or a fjord.

9
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,125
Quiet! I won't hear another word
against the boat.

10
00:00:56,293 --> 00:01:00,219
- Okay, TV off. It's family time.
- But, Marge...

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,877
...Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat.

12
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:07,098
Homer, you promised,
one night of family time a week.

13
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,387
Besides, that back-talking boat
sets a bad example.

14
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:11,830
Says you, woman.

15
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,675
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Mom.

16
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:16,494
All right, family time begins now.

17
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,695
- Homer.
- It was Bart.

18
00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:29,011
Why don't we all look
at the photo album.

19
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,091
So many memories.

20
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:34,413
Oh, look, Knightboat.

21
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:39,212
And here's our TV next to the mirror.

22
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:41,427
It looks like we have two.

23
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:43,944
- Two.
- Two.

24
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:47,601
Yeah, yeah, two.
Let's get to the baby pictures.

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,085
- Mom.
- That's exciting.

26
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,199
Oh, please.

27
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:57,568
Here's Bart sleeping.

28
00:01:57,736 --> 00:01:59,346
Here he is dozing.

29
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:02,232
Here he is after a visit
from the sandman.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,481
Here's nappy time, Bart.

31
00:02:04,648 --> 00:02:07,467
Here's a cute one.
He's all tuckered out.

32
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:09,984
Why aren't there any pictures
of Maggie?

33
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:15,554
Well, I'm glad you asked.
It's actually a very interesting story.

34
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:19,648
It all began about two years ago,
before Maggie was even born.

35
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:22,819
It was a tumultuous time
for our nation.

36
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:26,075
The clear-beverage craze gave us all
a reason to live.

37
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:28,893
The information superhighway
showed the average person...

38
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,410
...what some nerd thinks
about Star Trek.

39
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:35,940
And the domestication of the dog
continued unabated.

40
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:38,625
I was at my workstation
when suddenly...

41
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:40,873
Attention, American workers.

42
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:45,605
Your plant has been taken over by
an all-star team of freelance terrorists.

43
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:49,296
Not on my shift!

44
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:59,128
No, you don't.

45
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:03,088
Simpson, 10, terrorists, 8.

46
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:08,726
- Homer, tell the story right.
- Okay.

47
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,195
Homer, you should see a doctor.

48
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:17,115
I don't think a healthy man
can make that kind of smell.

49
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:18,692
Your paychecks, gentlemen.

50
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:25,269
This is it.
With a single glorious check...

51
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:28,591
...I'm finally completely out of debt.

52
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,954
Yes! With my bills paid off,
I can finally quit this lousy job.

53
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:39,967
But, Homer, how you gonna
make a living?

54
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:43,155
Don't worry about Homer J.
I've got a plan.

55
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,383
- A plan that'll fix you good.
- Hey, what did we do?

56
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:50,437
Sorry, that just slipped out.
I'll miss you.

57
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:53,457
Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty.

58
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,115
And since I quit,
I can do anything I want.

59
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:58,558
Is that so?

60
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:02,215
Lovely desk.
It would be too bad if someone...

61
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:06,075
...oh, I don't know,
didn't use a coaster!

62
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:10,571
Such a nice, tidy office.

63
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,195
Maybe it's time you started
living like a pig!

64
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:18,793
Oh, I hope I haven't upset you...

65
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,638
...bongo head!

66
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:27,417
Oh, I should be resisting this,
but I'm paralyzed with rage...

67
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,303
...and island rhythms.

68
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,551
Go, Homer. Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,001
Way to play the boss's head
like a bongo, Homer.

70
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:37,846
He's getting a pretty good sound
out of that guy.

71
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:46,571
That's for employing me
for eight years.

72
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,115
And that is that.

73
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:57,679
Goodbye, mind-numbing,
backbreaking labor forever.

74
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,967
Hello, dream job in paradise.

75
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:08,551
And now, the final phase of my plan.

76
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:14,390
Barney, any chance
you can get me a job?

77
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:19,323
Hey. Sure, Homer.
I told you, my uncle owns the place.

78
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:22,746
- Hey, Uncle Al, can Homer have a job?
- Sure.

79
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:27,645
- Barney, you're fired.
- Okay.

80
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,625
Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags.

81
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,504
Oh, and a change of pants.

82
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:33,585
- Why?
- When it happens, you'll know.

83
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,175
You're a pin monkey?

84
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:40,699
Finally, I don't have to be ashamed
of my father's job.

85
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,887
It's romantic, throwing off
the shackles of the workaday world...

86
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:46,202
...and following a dream, of sorts.

87
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:48,215
I don't know if it's such a good idea.

88
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,128
Can we get by
on a pin monkey's salary?

89
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,638
Don't worry, Marge.

90
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:54,491
I've come up with
a perfectly balanced budget.

91
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:58,819
There will be exactly enough money
for you, me, Bart and Lisa...

92
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:01,538
...if we make a few small sacrifices.

93
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:07,142
From now on,
we use regular toilet paper...

94
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:09,826
...not that fancy quilted kind.

95
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,652
And only one of you kids
can go to college.

96
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,296
- Fine.
- Fine.

97
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,658
That night, your mom and I
went out for a romantic evening...

98
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,739
...to celebrate
the start of our new life.

99
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:24,189
We began with dinner and dancing.

100
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,215
Followed by a stroll on the beach.

101
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,833
- Marge.
- Homer.

102
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:48,551
I've got sand in my underpants.

103
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:50,497
Me too. Let's go home.

104
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,477
I love you, Marge.

105
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:15,128
I love you too, Homie.

106
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:19,088
Everything in our lives
is finally perfectly balanced.

107
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:22,444
I hope things stay exactly
like this forever.

108
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:38,206
Did you have to be so graphic?

109
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:42,032
It's okay, Marge. They pave the way
for this kind of filth in school.

110
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,313
Dad, were you excited
that Mom was pregnant?

111
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,428
Actually, your mother
hadn't told me yet.

112
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:49,917
At that time, I had no idea
Maggie even existed.

113
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,636
- Dad!
- Dad!

114
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,313
Hi, Maggie.

115
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,186
So anyhow, back then
there was no way for me to know...

116
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,266
...your mother was pregnant.

117
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:03,320
Hey.

118
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,683
Marge, you tie up the bathroom
every morning. I've gotta wash my hair.

119
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:12,783
The next few weeks at my dream job
were like a wonderful waking coma.

120
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:17,481
- Hey, Homer.
- Hi there, Homer.

121
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:19,260
- Hi, Homer.
- Hi there, Homer.

122
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:20,938
Hi.

123
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:26,038
Bowling-fresh.

124
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:33,790
Urinal-fresh.

125
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:48,119
Homer, did you polish your head
in the Shine-O Ball-O?

126
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,602
- No.
- Okay, then.

127
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,132
I slowly learned the intricate mysteries
of the alley...

128
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,219
...like where the pins go
after they're knocked down.

129
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,602
I was in heaven.
If horseracing is the sport of kings...

130
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:22,448
...then surely, bowling...

131
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:25,870
...is a very good sport as well.

132
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:28,119
- Hey, great job, Homer.
- Thanks a lot, Homer.

133
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:29,931
Hey, you're the best.

134
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:35,099
I'm gonna make it after all

135
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:40,199
Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson.
You're pregnant.

136
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,293
Am I to take it that this is...

137
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:46,810
...an unwanted pregnancy?

138
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:49,629
Oh, no, no. Not exactly.

139
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,582
It's just that I haven't told Homer yet.
With his new job...

140
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,132
...I don't know how we'll
be able to afford this.

141
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,562
Well, you know, a healthy baby
can bring upwards of $60,000.

142
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:01,911
- What?!
- Of course, that was just a test.

143
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,374
Had you reacted differently, why,
you'd be in jail right now. Simply a test.

144
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:11,877
So in a few months, both of you
will have a brand-new brother or sister.

145
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,495
- Been there, done that.
- I hope it's a girl.

146
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:18,354
You know nothing about genetics, Lis.
It goes boy, girl, boy, girl.

147
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,777
- You're worried about telling Dad.
- Why do you say that?

148
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:24,394
Well, you've been in my room
for about four hours now.

149
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:26,542
Hey, I'm just hanging.

150
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:36,374
- Homie, I...
- Can't talk. Praying.

151
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:40,602
Dear Lord, the gods have been good
to me, and I am thankful.

152
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,830
For the first time in my life,
everything is absolutely perfect...

153
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:47,313
...just the way it is.

154
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,670
So here's the deal:
You freeze everything as it is...

155
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,550
...and I won't ask for anything more.

156
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:57,140
If that is okay,
please give me absolutely no sign.

157
00:10:57,308 --> 00:11:01,905
Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you
this offering of cookies and milk.

158
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:06,201
If you want me to eat them for you,
give me no sign. Thy will be done.

159
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,288
I've got to tell Homer about this baby
in just the right way...

160
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:21,268
...and at just the right time.

161
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:23,684
Until then, please keep this
to yourselves.

162
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:27,308
If he found out now, it would
probably destroy him, huh?

163
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,019
Oh, yes.

164
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:30,563
- Gotta go.
- Gotta go.

165
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,879
Wait a minute. Wait. I know that look.

166
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,026
Now, promise you won't tell Homer.

167
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,375
Oh, we promise we won't tell...

168
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,355
...Homer.

169
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,335
Hello. Is this A. Aaronson?

170
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:50,999
It might interest you to know that
Marge Simpson is pregnant again.

171
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:56,066
Just thought you'd like to know,
Mr. Zowkowski.

172
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:01,335
There. Aaronson and Zowkowski
are the two biggest gossips in town.

173
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,516
In an hour, everyone will know.

174
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:09,892
Another perfect day in my perfect life
with my perfect job.

175
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,744
Hey, just heard the news
over the squawk box.

176
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,899
- That's nice work, Homer.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

177
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:18,113
It is nice work.

178
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:22,308
Oh, Mr. Simpson, I have just heard
about the little bundle of joy.

179
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:25,798
- Congratulations, sir.
- It's true, the bundle is little...

180
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:28,885
...but I'm not in it for the money.

181
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,214
Hey, Homer,
way to get Marge pregnant.

182
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,939
This is getting very abstract,
but thank you...

183
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,791
...I do enjoy working
at the bowling alley.

184
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,422
Surprise! Baby shower.

185
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:47,610
Baby shower?
You know I haven't told Homer yet.

186
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:49,321
And he'll be home any minute.

187
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:50,899
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really?

188
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:57,946
Man, it's windy as hell out there.

189
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:02,672
Hey, wait a minute.
What are all these presents?

190
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,215
It looks like you're...

191
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,168
...showering Marge with gifts.

192
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,202
With little, tiny baby-sized gifts.

193
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,028
Well, I'll be in the tub.

194
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:19,450
By the way, congratulations
on your new job, Homer.

195
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:22,638
New job? Marge is pregnant?!

196
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:25,860
No!

197
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:32,202
Dad, you really threw a tantrum
like a little sissy girl?

198
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,645
Oh, just that one time.

199
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,028
Actually, when I was
about to have Bart...

200
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:38,175
You're pregnant?!

201
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,048
And then when I told him
about Lisa...

202
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:45,658
You're pregnant again?!

203
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:51,195
Who wouldn't be upset?

204
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,283
That new baby in your mother's womb
was a ticking time bomb...

205
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,504
...threatening to blow this family
eight ways from Sunday.

206
00:13:57,705 --> 00:14:00,021
- Where are you going?
- You can't expect a person...

207
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,799
...to sit for 30 minutes straight.

208
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,350
I'm gonna get a snack and maybe
go to the bathroom.

209
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:08,410
I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think
about products I might like to purchase.

210
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,215
I don't have that.

211
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:19,014
You're pregnant.

212
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:23,242
We're gonna have to have a baby.
All our financial plans are ruined.

213
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:26,598
We're doomed. Doomed, I tells you!

214
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:31,732
- Bart, let your father tell the story.
- Yeah.

215
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:34,517
- Okay, but I know funny.
- Anyhoo...

216
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,001
We're doomed!

217
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,081
- Homer, you had a head.
- Check.

218
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:41,497
And your bottom was a little bigger.

219
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,918
You've worked hard
at the bowling alley.

220
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:46,804
- Why don't you ask for a raise.
- Yeah, a raise.

221
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:49,455
I've never been good enough
at any job to deserve one.

222
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,307
But I'm damn good at this one.
That's it.

223
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:54,690
I'm gonna march
right up to Al and say:

224
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:58,247
Steve. I mean, Al,
I think I deserve a raise.

225
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,864
You're a hard worker.
I'd like to give you a raise.

226
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:04,522
But the alley just ain't doing enough
business to pay that kind of money.

227
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:08,851
How about if I triple the business?
Then could I get a raise?

228
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:10,764
Well, yeah, but...

229
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,301
Of course.

230
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:39,858
Bowling. Bowling here.

231
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,375
Come bowl now. Get your bowling.

232
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,388
Who's ready? Bowling.

233
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,905
Mom, make Dad tell the story right.

234
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:49,119
That's what really happened.

235
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:53,381
My marketing plan attracted a record
number of police and fire officials...

236
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:56,838
...but few stayed to bowl. I failed.

237
00:15:57,005 --> 00:16:01,200
Quitting my dream job
was the hardest thing I've ever done.

238
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,012
You did a great job, Homer.

239
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,898
I'm really gonna miss you.
Place has never been cleaner.

240
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:09,287
And the way you kept the young people
away, that was beautiful.

241
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:11,133
Oh, yeah. Thanks for that.

242
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:15,529
Anyway, we all pitched in, and we
got you this little going-away thing.

243
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,710
This was the happiest time of my life.

244
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:24,891
I'll never forget you guys.

245
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,375
Especially you, Joey.

246
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,858
- See you around, Mr. Homer.
- Don't worry, Joey.

247
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:32,475
We'll make it to California someday.

248
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:35,093
Sure, we will, Mr. Homer.
Sure, we will.

249
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:39,891
It's gonna be sad around here
without you, Homer.

250
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,106
- Yeah.
- Sure is.

251
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,750
- Boy, this is depressing.
- I know what'd cheer us up. Bowling.

252
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:53,918
Look at this, I got a ball here.

253
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:58,130
I needed more money to support
my growing family.

254
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:03,096
And there was only one place in town
that a man like me could make it.

255
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:20,378
Acid rain again.

256
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:38,029
Yes? Are you a new applicant?

257
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,955
- I quit, and I came to get my job back.
- Through there.

258
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,264
So come crawling back, eh?

259
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:57,190
Seems like the classy thing to do
would be not to call attention to it.

260
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:01,653
- Thanks for giving me my old job back.
- I'm afraid it's not that simple.

261
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,633
As punishment for your desertion...

262
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:07,425
...it's company policy
to give you the plague.

263
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,270
Sir, that's the "plaque."

264
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:12,559
Yes, the special
de-motivational plaque...

265
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,378
...to break what's left of your spirit.

266
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:19,606
Because, you see,
you're here forever.

267
00:18:22,224 --> 00:18:24,673
"Don't forget: You're here forever."

268
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:33,734
I've never been so miserable
in all my life.

269
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:36,116
But I can't take it out
on Marge and the kids.

270
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:39,707
I've gotta carry the burden
all by myself.

271
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:43,499
- Hi, honey. How are you?
- Well, actually...

272
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,224
Oh, I can't go on with this charade.
I hate my job. I hate my life.

273
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:50,344
Since I found out about this baby,
there's been only bad luck.

274
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,760
My contractions started an hour ago.

275
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:55,747
Just in one ear and out the other
with you, isn't it?

276
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,096
It's wonderful. It's magical. Oh, boy.

277
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,915
Here it comes, another mouth.

278
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:05,130
One more push should do it.

279
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:06,942
Marvelous.

280
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:14,324
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.
You have a beautiful, healthy baby.

281
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:16,875
Okay.

282
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:23,015
Homie, I think someone
is saying hello.

283
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,291
Hello.

284
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:29,626
It's a boy. And what a boy!

285
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:33,351
That's the umbilical cord. It's a girl.

286
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:38,385
A girl. Oh, Marge,
we have a wonderful baby girl.

287
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:43,922
Not just a girl. The most beautiful
baby girl in the whole world.

288
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:48,385
Come on, Marge,
show a little enthusiasm.

289
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,150
So you loved her right from the start.

290
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,472
Absolutely.

291
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:04,861
- Then why no pictures?
- Oh, there are pictures.

292
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:08,049
I keep them where I need
the most cheering up.
