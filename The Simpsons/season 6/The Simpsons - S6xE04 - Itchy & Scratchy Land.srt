1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,537
Itchy and Scratchy Land

2
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:10,304
Thanks, kids. Now I'd like to speak
to you seriously for a moment.

3
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,607
Yep. This week is the grand opening
of Itchy & Scratchy Land.

4
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,243
The violentest place on Earth.

5
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,181
And to celebrate, for this week only,
we're cutting ticket prices in half.

6
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,721
Kids, you heard the cartoon rat.

7
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,024
If you haven't already run to your
parents begging to go, do it now.

8
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,927
You won't miss anything funny.
I'll just be sitting here...

9
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,964
...reading this grownups’ newspaper.

10
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,800
Go now.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,003
Dad, remember how you said that
going to Itchy & Scratchy Land...

12
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,771
...would be too damned expensive?

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,207
Oh, everything's too damn
expensive these days.

14
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:52,513
Look at this Bible I just got, 15 bucks.
And talk about a preachy book.

15
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,616
Everybody's a sinner,
except for this guy.

16
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,919
But now Itchy & Scratchy Land
is cutting ticket prices in half.

17
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,488
Can we go, Dad? Can we,
can we, can we? Take it, Lis.

18
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,458
- Can we?
- No, no, no. Ask your mother.

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,531
- Mom, guess what.
- We're going to Itchy & Scratchy Land.

20
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,433
No. I've already planned our vacation.

21
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,570
We're going to the Highway 9
bird sanctuary.

22
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:20,240
I understand they've installed
a new bird feeder this year.

23
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:26,013
It's shaped like a diner.
And it's on this really tall pole.

24
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:34,144
Mom, Dad, Bart's dead!

25
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,973
That's right. Dead serious about
going to Itchy & Scratchy Land.

26
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:42,740
You know, Itchy & Scratchy Land
isn't just for kids.

27
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:45,788
They have a place called
Parents' Island.

28
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,240
Yeah. Dancing, bowling, fashionable
shops, over 100 bars and saloons...

29
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:53,390
...and a world-class
chemical-dependency center.

30
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:56,267
TV Town. Hammock Land!

31
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:58,870
"Recipe-related bumper cars."

32
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,856
Wait a minute. I'm not sure about this.

33
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:09,589
Every time we've ever gone on vacation,
I end up being horribly embarrassed.

34
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:12,945
We have a big fight and we come home
more miserable than when we left.

35
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:15,925
You have to promise me that this
isn't gonna happen this time.

36
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,582
- Embarrassed? What do you mean?
- Well, our trip to the Amish country.

37
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,603
Oh, yes.

38
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,507
Hey, look, Marge.
They're still not fighting back.

39
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:30,925
I can be a jerk
and no one can stop me.

40
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:35,180
Even worse was our trip
to Sandy Beach.

41
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,056
Suckers.

42
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,726
Sharkboy!

43
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,597
This year I want us to do things
together as a family.

44
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,800
And get a lot of
good exercise outdoors...

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,104
...so we'll have a lot of
wonderful memories of our vacation.

46
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,573
Don't worry, Mom.
We'll make you proud of us.

47
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:02,811
Lobster hat, fishnet Speedo Jr.,
wheelie shoes...

48
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:04,880
...invisible-dog leash.

49
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:07,250
Well, I'm packed.

50
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,686
Remember, every morning,
give a bowl of kibble...

51
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:12,923
...to Santa's Little Helper.
Do you want me to write this down?

52
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,726
No. I ain't senile, dad blast it.

53
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,396
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye, Grampa.

54
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:21,132
Wait a minute. What was
that last thing you said?

55
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:25,170
Grampa's Little Helper? What's that?

56
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,340
Which one of you is the mailman?

57
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,312
Okay, let's make a pact. This is
gonna be the best vacation ever...

58
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,549
...or we'll all agree to disband
and join other families.

59
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:37,717
Agreed.

60
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,722
The interstate.
Fasten your seatbelts, kids.

61
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,892
We're on our way to
Itchy & Scratchy Land.

62
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:50,532
Don't worry. I've got an ace
up my sleeve.

63
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:59,932
Now to absorb some local color
through the magic of AM radio.

64
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:04,899
The book of Revelation tells us
to watch for the seven signs of evil.

65
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,939
Sign of evil number four...

66
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:12,027
Continuing our sign-of-evil countdown,
here's Vanessa Williams.

67
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:18,581
Haven't we stood in five
different states long enough?

68
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,270
No.

69
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:31,419
We better find a motel
and stop for the night.

70
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:35,980
We don't need to do that, Marge.
I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all.

71
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:42,399
Glad that wasn't us.

72
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:47,466
North, south. Nuts to this.

73
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:51,115
- I'm gonna take a shortcut.
- Homer, no. You're gonna get lost.

74
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:55,101
Trust me, Marge. With today's
modern cars, you can't get lost.

75
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,736
What with all the silicon chips
and such.

76
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,946
All right, we're here. Let us
never speak of the shortcut again.

77
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:14,122
Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot.

78
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,689
We're now approaching our final
destination, Itchy & Scratchy Land.

79
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:25,405
The amusement park of the future
where nothing can possib-lie go wrong.

80
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:28,277
Possibly go wrong.

81
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,689
That's the first thing
that's ever gone wrong.

82
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,696
One adult and four children.

83
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,926
Do you want to buy some
Itchy & Scratchy money?

84
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,324
- What's that?
- Money that's made for the park.

85
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:57,399
It works just like regular money,
but it's fun.

86
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:00,338
- Do it, Dad.
- Well, okay. If it's fun.

87
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:03,480
Let's see. I'll take $ 1100 worth.

88
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:16,081
- Cool, that is neato.
- Oh, wow. Cool.

89
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:18,547
Such a violent motif.

90
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:22,297
Yeah, but it's just pretend violence,
which is actually beneficial for children.

91
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,493
There's no need to murmur, ma'am.
Here at Itchy & Scratchy Land...

92
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:32,432
...we're just as concerned
about violence as you are.

93
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,304
That's why we're always careful
to show the consequences...

94
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:38,412
...of deadly mayhem so that we may
educate as well as horrify.

95
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:40,304
When do you show the consequences?

96
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:42,568
On TV, that mouse pulled out
the cat's lungs...

97
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:44,291
...and played them like a bagpipe.

98
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,554
In the next scene,
the cat's breathing comfortably.

99
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,872
Just like in real life.

100
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,034
Hey, look over there.

101
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,318
- A brain burger with extra pus, please.
- Bart.

102
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,480
- Eyeball stew.
- Homer. We just got here...

103
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:02,061
...and already I'm mortified beyond
belief by your embarrassing behavior.

104
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,878
I was just ordering a cheeseburger. They
have violent names for everything here.

105
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,459
Oh, I see. All right.

106
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:14,122
- I'll have the baby guts.
- Lady, you disgust me.

107
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:16,858
Mom, that's veal.

108
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:26,298
- You sure she'll have fun here?
- Of course. Babies love the ball room.

109
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:39,464
Torture Land, Explosion Land...

110
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:45,662
...Searing Gas Pain Land,
Unnecessary Surgery Land.

111
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,045
Oh, look. It's the 12 noon robot parade.

112
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:51,692
Hurry up or we'll have
to wait for the 12:05 parade.

113
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:15,511
Wow, this is so much like
my dreams, it's scary.

114
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:22,010
Look at that cute little baby ax.

115
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:27,873
It's cute, but I'm sure it's
very sharp and probably dirty.

116
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:31,524
Dirty, maybe. Dangerous, hardly.

117
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:34,070
These are state-of-the-art
animatronic robots.

118
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:38,760
They have sensors that ensure they only
attack each other, never the guests.

119
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:57,152
See all that stuff in there, Homer?
That's why your robot never worked.

120
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,285
This is just what I was hoping for,
spending the day together as a family.

121
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,390
You know, part of spending time
together as a family...

122
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,970
...is spending time apart as individuals.

123
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,410
Parents' Island?

124
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:38,660
I'm sure we'll appreciate each other
more when we meet up at dinner.

125
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,254
Are you kids gonna be all right? Kids?

126
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,080
It is the '70s. Right down
to the smallest detail.

127
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:56,592
Hey, the bartender even looks
like John Travolta.

128
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,703
Yeah, "looks like."

129
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:04,365
Look at all this great stuff, Lis.
Cool. Personalized plates.

130
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:08,418
Barclay, Barry, Bert... Bort?

131
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,127
Come on. "Bort"?

132
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:13,644
- Mommy, buy me a license plate.
- No. Come along, Bort.

133
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:17,162
- Are you talking to me?
- No. My son is also named Bort.

134
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:20,278
- Who are all these characters?
- You're too young to remember...

135
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:24,298
...the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy
& Friends Hour. They had to have friends.

136
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,346
There's Disgruntled Goat,
Uncle Ant, Ku Klux Klam.

137
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:30,931
Oh, yeah. They weren't very funny.

138
00:11:31,132 --> 00:11:33,075
I don't know. Disgruntled Goat
had his moments.

139
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:53,845
Welcome to T.G.I. McScratchy's,
where it's constantly New Year's Eve.

140
00:11:54,046 --> 00:12:00,010
Here we go again. Three, two, one.

141
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:12,549
It must be wonderful to ring in
the new year over and over and over.

142
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,589
Please kill me.

143
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,410
Roger Meyers Sr., the gentle genius
behind Itchy and Scratchy...

144
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,651
...loved and cared about almost
all the peoples of the world.

145
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:36,651
And he in return was beloved
by the world...

146
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:41,331
...except in 1938, when he was
criticized for his controversial cartoon...

147
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,371
..."Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors."

148
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:48,851
Among his proudest achievements was
the full-length musical Scratchtasia.

149
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,253
Hey, Ma, I'm gonna get me
a picture of this crazy critter.

150
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,334
No flash photography, please.

151
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:57,934
Roger Meyers’ next full-length feature
was the wildly successful Pinitchio.

152
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:02,934
Now, you be a good Pinitchio,
and don't you lie.

153
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:05,374
I promise I will never hurt you.

154
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:10,214
I wonder if this kind of violence
really does desensitize us.

155
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:16,975
- Wanna get a snow cone?
- Okay.

156
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:26,415
So, Mr. Itchy, you think you're
God's gift to women, do you?

157
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,775
Don't do it, Bart.

158
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:37,656
I just wanted to entertain.

159
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:41,496
Can you believe I keep
getting away with this?

160
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,336
Officer.

161
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:52,936
Mop-and-bucket man to the
exit of the Nauseator.

162
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:55,376
Another jumper on the roof
of T.G.I. McScratchy's.

163
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:58,136
We need more Bort license plates
in the gift shop.

164
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:01,617
I repeat, we are sold out
of Bort license plates.

165
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:05,697
I really wish they wouldn't scream.

166
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:11,377
- Dad?
- I kicked one of those...

167
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:14,217
...stupid Itchy characters in the butt.
- Yeah.

168
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,337
There's just no way
to resist it, is there?

169
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:21,497
I want all five T-shirts to say
"best vacation ever."

170
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:24,897
Attention, Marge Simpson.
Your son has been arrested.

171
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:28,698
I'd be terribly embarrassed
if I were that boy's mother.

172
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:36,198
Attention, Marge Simpson. We've also
arrested your older, balder, fatter son.

173
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:43,878
I'm so embarrassed, I wish there was
a hole I could just crawl into and die.

174
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,798
- Okay, throw her in the hole.
- Please. It was just a figure of speech.

175
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:54,359
You've got to listen to me.
Elementary chaos theory tells us...

176
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,319
...that all robots will eventually turn
against their masters and run amok...

177
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:02,119
...in an orgy of blood and kicking
and the biting with the metal teeth...

178
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,479
...and the hurting and shoving.
- How much time do we have, professor?

179
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,799
According to my calculations, the robots
won't go berserk for at least 24 hours.

180
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,359
Oh, I forgot to carry the one.

181
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,160
- I have nothing to say to you.
- But, Marge, I was a political prisoner.

182
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,920
- How are you a political prisoner?
- I kicked a giant mouse in the butt.

183
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,600
Do I have to draw you a diagram?

184
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,440
Oh, for gosh sakes. What now?

185
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,761
Hey, look. This one's coming on to me.

186
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,201
Mr. Robot.

187
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,161
You're wrong about that robot
trying to be your friend.

188
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:58,681
Lisa, don't contradict your elders.

189
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,961
My hair. You chopped off my hair.
Oh, God, I'm ugly.

190
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,561
I knew we should've gone
to the bird sanctuary.

191
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:15,122
I need the biggest seed bell you have.

192
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,002
No, that's too big.

193
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,322
A chopper. We're saved.

194
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:24,722
Hey, you're the guys
who didn't like our capering.

195
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:27,522
When you get to hell,
tell them Itchy sent you.

196
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:34,043
Oh, my. It looks like we're doomed.

197
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:38,483
Back, you robot. Nobody ruins
my family vacation but me.

198
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,363
And maybe the boy.

199
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:01,364
Dad, the flash must have
scrambled their circuits.

200
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:05,204
- What are you, the narrator?
- Just keep taking pictures.

201
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:07,764
I'll get more cameras!

202
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,524
Smashy-smashy.

203
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,964
I don't approve of that.

204
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:24,045
Hey, mouse. Say cheese.

205
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:28,565
With a dry, cool wit like that,
I could be an action hero.

206
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:40,005
Die, bad robots. Die!

207
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:44,365
- With a dry, cool wit like that...
- Who'd think that visiting...

208
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:47,486
...Itchy & Scratchy Land would
be our best vacation ever?

209
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:51,086
- Yeah, best ever.
- Are you two bonkers?

210
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,646
We almost got killed. Not to mention
all the embarrassment I suffered.

211
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:57,246
But, Mom, it's exactly what
you wanted in a vacation.

212
00:18:57,406 --> 00:19:01,246
It brought us together as a family,
we got a lot of good exercise outdoors...

213
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:03,366
...and we have so many memories.

214
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:06,966
You know, you're right.
This truly was the best vacation ever.

215
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,646
Now, let us never speak of it again.

216
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:13,327
As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner
of the park, I'd like to thank you...

217
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,207
...for stopping the killer robots.

218
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:18,047
And to show my appreciation,
here are two free passes.

219
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,527
- There are five of us.
- Here are two free passes.

220
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:24,047
- That's better.
- Man, if this is happening here...

221
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,647
...I hate to think what's happening
in Euro-Itchy & Scratchy Land.

222
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:36,067
Hello. Itchy & Scratchy Land,
open for business.

223
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:39,228
Who are you to resist it, huh?

224
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,228
Come on, my last paycheck bounced.

225
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:44,468
My children need wine.

226
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:55,588
I hope you realize now that
violence on TV may be funny...

227
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:58,628
...but it's not so funny when
that violence is happening to you.

228
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:01,708
But it would be funny to someone
who was watching us.

229
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,549
No, Mom. He's right. Observe.

230
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,829
Oh, my. Lisa, go to your room.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
