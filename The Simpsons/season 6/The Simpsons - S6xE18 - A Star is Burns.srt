1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,283
A Star Is Burns

2
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:28,545
Hello, I'm Kent Brockman,
and this is Eye on Springfield.

3
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,464
Tonight, Springfield's answer
to the Benedictine monks:

4
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:08,579
The rapping rabbis.

5
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,666
Don 't eat pork
Not even with a fork

6
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,243
Can 't touch this

7
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:14,921
Marge, are we Jewish?

8
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:17,136
No, Homer.

9
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,538
- But first, we all stink.
- We all... Hey!

10
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:27,572
According to a survey ranking Springfield
as the least popular city in America.

11
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,417
In science, dead last.

12
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:33,847
I'm telling you people,
the Earth revolves around the sun.

13
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:35,424
Burn him!

14
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:40,089
- What a story.
- You've stolen my soul!

15
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,068
In culture, dead last.

16
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,102
Eleanor, we've got to do something
about this depression. So I propose...

17
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,089
Oh, that's right. I'm crippled.

18
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,277
This is terrible. People
will start to avoid Springfield.

19
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,793
But what can I do? I'm just...

20
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:58,780
...one man.
- I think we should call a town meeting.

21
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:01,565
If we don't do something soon,
we won't get any tourists.

22
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,766
Are there any suggestions
for how to attract more tourism?

23
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:11,571
The easiest way to be popular
is to leech off the popularity of others.

24
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:16,907
So we propose changing our name
from Springfield to Seinfeld.

25
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm Marge Simpson,
and I have an idea.

26
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,469
Oh, no.

27
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:25,448
Marge is gonna say something.

28
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,301
Now, I know you haven't liked
some of my past suggestions.

29
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:30,281
Like switching to the metric system.

30
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:34,274
The metric system
is the tool of the devil!

31
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:40,247
My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead,
and that's the way I likes it!

32
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,462
The old person's remarks
will be stricken.

33
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,905
Who said that?

34
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:45,482
But my new idea is different.

35
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,744
I think we should hold a film festival
and give out prizes.

36
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,757
Could we make movies
and enter them?

37
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,213
- Yes.
- At last, an excuse to wear makeup.

38
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:58,200
All in favor of Marge Simpson's
film-festival idea?

39
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,885
Film festival! Film festival!

40
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,341
You like my idea?
Actually, I have several others.

41
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:07,697
Don 't push your luck!
Don 't push your luck!

42
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:10,918
And action.

43
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,663
Hello, I'm Bart Simpson.

44
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:16,254
In the past, I've brought you such
classic films as Homer in the Shower...

45
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:17,730
...and Homer on the Toilet.

46
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,925
And now I give you The Eternal Struggle.

47
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,589
Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny.
Stupid Dockers.

48
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:30,348
Oh, the belt is buckled.

49
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,019
Now, Maude, in our movie,
you lay baby Moses in the basket...

50
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:37,932
...then put it among the reeds, okay?

51
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,643
Lights, camera...

52
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:42,697
...act-diddily-dotilly-doodilly
action Jackson.

53
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:49,777
Help me!

54
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:55,113
Flanders to God
Flanders to God

55
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:58,401
Get off your cloud and save my Todd

56
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,267
- Thanks, God.
- Okely-dokely.

57
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:09,777
What you doing, Ma?

58
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,227
Looking for a film critic
to judge our festival.

59
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:14,878
Did you know there are
over 600 critics on TV...

60
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,267
...and Leonard Maltin is
the best-looking of them all?

61
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:22,965
Welcome to Coming Attractions.
I'm your host, Jay Sherman. Thank you.

62
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,764
Tonight we review an aging
Charles Bronson in Death Wish IX.

63
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:30,683
I wish I was dead.

64
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:33,435
But first we have a special guest,
Rainier Wolfcastle...

65
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:37,428
...star of the reprehensible
McBain movies.

66
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,683
Jay, my new film is a mix
of action und comedy.

67
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:44,307
It's called McBain: Let's Get Silly.

68
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,905
Did you ever notice how men
always leave the toilet seat up?

69
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:53,267
- That's the joke.
- You suck, McBain!

70
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:57,630
Now my Woody Allen impression.

71
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,388
I'm a neurotic nerd who likes
to sleep with little girls.

72
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,838
Hey, that really sucked!

73
00:05:07,993 --> 00:05:11,517
The film is just me in front of
a brick wall for an hour and a half.

74
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,134
It cost $80 million.

75
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:16,114
How do you sleep at night?

76
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,973
On top of a pile of money
with many beautiful ladies.

77
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,289
Just asking.

78
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,940
I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive.

79
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,423
He's not obsessed
with his physical appearance.

80
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:29,168
My ears are burning.

81
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:31,651
I wasn't talking about you, Dad.

82
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:35,376
No, my ears are really burning.
I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-Tip.

83
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,604
Dear Mr. Sherman, on behalf
of the people of Springfield...

84
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,027
...I would like to invite you
to judge our film festival.

85
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:46,685
You can stay with us and enjoy
the sights and sounds of the country.

86
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:50,242
- Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?
- Just a minute, Homer.

87
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,685
Look what you made me write.

88
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,772
Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy
our quiet little town.

89
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,322
Sincerely, Marge Simpson.

90
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,242
Do I really wanna leave Manhattan?

91
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:04,940
Sherman, I just realized
you insulted me. Now you will die.

92
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,792
Hey, nudnik, your shoe's untied.

93
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:12,020
From here, they appear to be tied.
But I will go in for a closer look.

94
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,685
Taxi. To the airport!

95
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:23,161
On closer inspection, these are Loafers.

96
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:28,972
Attention, the flight
from New York has arrived.

97
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,650
Hey, I'm landing here.

98
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,858
It's supposed to say Jay's name,
not yours.

99
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,643
Oh, you're right.

100
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,234
There you...

101
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:47,260
Just a second. Oh, that should...

102
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:50,549
Hello, I'm Marge Simpson,
and this is my husband, Homer.

103
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:53,536
Oh, nice to meet you, Marge.
I saw your hair from the plane.

104
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:58,133
And you must be the man who didn't
know if he had a pimple or a boil.

105
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,643
It was a gummy bear.

106
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,073
Coming up next, The Flintstones
Meet the Jetsons.

107
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,589
I smell another
cheap cartoon crossover.

108
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:10,643
Bart Simpson,
meet Jay Sherman the critic.

109
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:13,026
- Hello.
- Hey, man, I really love your show.

110
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:14,905
I think all kids should watch it.

111
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,656
I suddenly feel so dirty.

112
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:27,585
I don't know what's happening. It seems
our profits have dropped 37 percent.

113
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:29,095
We have a bad image, sir.

114
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:31,847
Research shows people see you
as something of an ogre.

115
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:34,431
I ought to club them
and eat their bones.

116
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,212
Maybe this film festival could help us.

117
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,132
A film biography might let them
get to know the real you.

118
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,682
Virtuous, heroic, nubile.

119
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,930
You left out "pleasant."

120
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,279
But I like that film-biography idea.

121
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:51,608
A slick Hollywood picture
to gloss over my evil rise to power...

122
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,454
...like Bugsy or Working Girl.

123
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:55,199
Get me Steven Spielberg.

124
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:59,226
- He's unavailable.
- Get his nonunion Mexican equivalent.

125
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,870
Listen, Señor Spielbergo...

126
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:04,226
...I want you to do for me
what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler.

127
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,921
Listen, Spielbergo, Schindler and I
are like peas in a pod.

128
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:15,042
We're both factory owners.
We both made shells for the Nazis.

129
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,170
But mine worked, damn it. Now,
go out there and win me that festival!

130
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,679
Homer, the guest should get
the last pork chop.

131
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,783
But I'm still hungry.

132
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,162
Mr. Sherman, I understand
you have two Pulitzer Prizes.

133
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:45,714
Well, it's not like I carry them
around with me.

134
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:48,093
It's so hot in here.

135
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:53,714
Oh, look, here's my People's Choice
Award. Five Golden Globes...

136
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:57,162
Where's my Emmy?

137
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,507
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, I won...

138
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,783
...the belching contest at work.

139
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,231
Very nice, Homer.

140
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:20,955
Wow, how many Pulitzer Prize winners
can do that?

141
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,093
Just me and Eudora Welty.

142
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:26,024
I invited my sisters over.

143
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:29,231
Sisters. Allow me.

144
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:39,679
So then I said to Woody Allen, "Well,
Camus can do, but Sartre is 'smartre.'"

145
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:41,438
So original.

146
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,921
How droll.

147
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:46,576
Yeah, well,
Scooby-Doo can doo-doo...

148
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:50,162
...but Jimmy Carter is smarter.

149
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:59,231
- Okay, Sherman, you're a movie expert.
- So tell us, who's gay?

150
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:01,300
Oh, I don't know. Harvey Fierstein.

151
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:04,197
- No.
- Who else?

152
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,266
MacGyver's gay.

153
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,679
You badmouthed MacGyver,
didn't you?

154
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,128
What you doing, Marge?

155
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,369
Making the jury list
for the film festival.

156
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:28,197
Mayor Quimby, Krusty, Jay.

157
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:31,679
Marge, do you respect my intelligence?

158
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,472
- Yes.
- Okay.

159
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:39,266
Wait a minute. Why did it take you
so long to say yes?

160
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,197
- No reason.
- Okay.

161
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:47,472
Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?

162
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:51,852
- Yes.
- Okay.

163
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:54,128
Wait a minute. That's bad!

164
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:57,128
Look, I know I'm not witty
like that critic guy...

165
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,817
...but does he know all the words
to the Oscar Mayer song?

166
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,128
Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener

167
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:08,817
That is what I'd truly like to be

168
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,714
'Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wiener

169
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:20,197
Everyone would be in love with me

170
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,748
That's it, Marge. He knows
the whole hot-dog song.

171
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:32,714
Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take
a lock of your hair to remember you by.

172
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:35,266
It's just you and me now, lock of hair.

173
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:37,162
You don't have to do this.

174
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:40,093
- You think I'm stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.

175
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,852
Prove it. Put me
on that film-jury-festival thing.

176
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,990
Fine. You're on the jury.

177
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,610
Sir, the actors are here
to audition for the part of you.

178
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,197
Excellent.

179
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,817
Excellent.

180
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,852
- Next.
- Excellent.

181
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:07,541
- Next.
- Exactly.

182
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:09,921
Next.

183
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:15,197
Oh, it's hopeless.
I'll have to play myself.

184
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:23,403
I thought they were playing
The Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight.

185
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:27,024
Our first film is by Indian director
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.

186
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:30,334
Bright Lights, Beef Jerky.

187
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,886
Help! Help! Police!

188
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:35,438
Hey, I got problems of my own
right now. Oh, boy.

189
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,093
This is gonna get worse
before it gets better.

190
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:44,403
Next, we have Moe the bartender
in Moe Better Booze.

191
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:49,093
Money gets you one more round
Drink it down, you stupid clown

192
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:54,403
Money gets you one more round
You're out on your ass

193
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,817
My back!

194
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,576
Hans Moleman Productions presents...

195
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:05,472
...Man Getting Hit by Football.

196
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:16,369
This contest is over.
Give that man the $ 10,000!

197
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:19,334
This isn't America 's
Funniest Home Videos.

198
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:26,197
But the ball, his groin.
It works on so many levels.

199
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:28,128
Roll it again.

200
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,197
Next, they're gonna show my movie.

201
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:33,266
- You made a movie?
- I made a movie?

202
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,541
No wonder I was on the cover
of Entertainment Weekly.

203
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:49,334
My name is Barney Gumble.
I'm 40, I'm single, and I drink.

204
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,507
There's a line in Othello about a drinker.

205
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,197
Now a sensible man, by and by a fool,
and presently a beast.

206
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,059
That pretty well covers it.

207
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:15,355
It's brilliant. Savagely honest.
Tender. He has the soul of a poet.

208
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:16,838
You're very kind.

209
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,700
Excuse me. Did something crawl
down your throat and die?

210
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:21,321
It didn't die.

211
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,941
My name is Barney,
and I'm an alcoholic.

212
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:26,183
Mr. Gumble, this is
a Girl Scout meeting.

213
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:30,976
Is it? Or is it that you girls
can't admit you have a problem?

214
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:41,217
Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead.

215
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:53,769
I think we have a winner.

216
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:56,355
- What'd I miss?
- Homer, please pay attention.

217
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,355
There's just one more movie.

218
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,058
Simple villagers, I promise you...

219
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,481
...I will close plants in America
and bring work here.

220
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,568
We did 20 takes,
and that was the best one.

221
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:31,924
Remember, Elliott, I'll be right here.

222
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:44,585
- Pure egotism.
- Self-indulgent tripe.

223
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:48,242
I don't care what they say.
I'm going to win this festival.

224
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,497
Drink up, Judah Ben-Hur.

225
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,504
You truly are the king of kings.

226
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:11,195
Excellent.

227
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,933
Smithers, are they booing me?

228
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:19,700
No. They're saying,
"Boo-urns, Boo-urns."

229
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,533
Are you saying, "Boo," or, "Boo-urns"?

230
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,967
I was saying, "Boo-urns."

231
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,550
All right, it's time to vote
for the grand prize.

232
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,317
I vote for Barney Gumble's sensitive
yet unfortunately titled film, Pukahantas.

233
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,883
- Second!
- Well, I vote for Burns' movie.

234
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:45,583
Me too. Now let's get going.
I got a date with Eudora Welty.

235
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,417
Coming, Eudora!

236
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:54,417
Excellent. Bribing those
two judges has paid off.

237
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:56,217
Like the Miss Teen America pageant.

238
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,717
How can you vote for Burns' movie?

239
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:04,217
Let's just say it moved me
to a bigger house!

240
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,050
I said the quiet part loud
and the loud part quiet. Oh, dear.

241
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:11,217
Two to two. Well, Homer,
it all comes down to you.

242
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,050
Football in the Groin!
Football in the Groin!

243
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,150
We're not gonna resolve
this deadlock anytime soon.

244
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:19,533
Why don't we all take
a five-minute break. It'll clear our heads.

245
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,033
Good idea, Marge.
My mind is going a mile a minute.

246
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:30,133
I knew this would happen.
I put you on the jury...

247
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:34,033
...and you vote for the stupidest film.
- I have a right to be on that jury...

248
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:37,133
...even though I'm sleeping with
the head of the festival.

249
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,133
How many times have
I heard Rex Reed say that?

250
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,200
Great. Now you're
gonna make fun of me.

251
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:43,800
No, Homer. I won't make fun.

252
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:46,667
But I will suggest there may be
better things in life...

253
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,133
...than seeing a man get hit
in the groin with a football.

254
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,633
Well, Homer?

255
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,767
Marge, I've got some
serious thinking to do.

256
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,418
Barney's movie had heart.

257
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:04,022
But Football in the Groin
had a football in the groin.

258
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:07,860
Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead.

259
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:10,796
Wow, I'll never drink another beer.

260
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:12,632
- Beer here.
- I'll take 10.

261
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,768
And now to announce the winners.

262
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,238
The award for outstanding
animated short goes to...

263
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:23,511
...Itchy and Scratchy for their film
Four Funerals and a Wedding.

264
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:51,478
And now the winner of the grand prize.

265
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:55,583
Barney Gumble!

266
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:57,418
What?

267
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:05,794
Homie, you voted for the right movie.
I'm glad you were on the jury.

268
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:11,968
You know something, Marge?
It's not that tough being a film cricket.

269
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:14,771
I've learned I have
a gift to share with the world.

270
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:20,411
From now on, there'll be a new Barnard
Gumble. Hardworking, clean and sober.

271
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:23,681
Congratulations, Barney.
And enjoy your grand prize...

272
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:27,152
...a lifetime supply of Duff Beer.

273
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:30,823
Just hook it to my veins!

274
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:36,396
Goodbye, Mr. Sherman. If I ever play
Carnegie Hall, I'll give you a call.

275
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:38,465
And if you ever want
to visit my show...

276
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:40,167
We're not gonna be doing that.

277
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,169
I hope you tell your New York friends...

278
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:45,473
...that people in small towns aren't
quite as dumb as they think.

279
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,009
Marge, look.
This has spring snakes inside...

280
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:51,213
...but the suckers
will think it's beer nuts.

281
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:53,749
Beer nuts.

282
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,620
Well, it was a lovely festival.
The best movie won...

283
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,191
...and Mr. Burns found there are
some awards that can't be bought.

284
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:02,559
And the Oscar goes to...

285
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:07,498
I've got to win this one.
I bribed everyone in Hollywood.

286
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:10,902
...George C. Scott in
Man Getting Hit by Football.

287
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:19,945
My groin.
