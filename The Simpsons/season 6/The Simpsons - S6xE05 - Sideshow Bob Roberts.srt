1
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,837
Sideshow Bob Roberts

2
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:24,680
No sports, no rock
No information

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,571
For mindless chatter
We're your station

4
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:30,599
KBBL talk radio. Now Springfield's
favorite conservative...

5
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:33,660
...author of well-selling book
Only Turkeys Have Left Wings...

6
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,721
...ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow.

7
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:41,143
That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot.

8
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:44,544
He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity.
Can you believe that?

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,844
Yeah, switch the station.
I consider myself politically correct.

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,952
His views make me uncomfortable.

11
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:52,946
No, no, no, guys.
Now, I'm not very political.

12
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:56,075
I usually think people who vote
are a bit fruity.

13
00:00:56,245 --> 00:01:00,293
But for some reason,
this Birch Barlow really speaks to me.

14
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,129
Good morning, freedom-likers.

15
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:10,259
Birch Barlow, the fourth branch
of government, the 51st state.

16
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:13,898
You know, there are three things
we'll never get rid of in Springfield:

17
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,939
One, the bats in the public library.

18
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:19,918
Two, Mrs. McFearley's compost heap.

19
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:26,721
And three, our six-term mayor...

20
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:30,463
...the illiterate, tax-cheating,
pot-smoking spend-o-crat...

21
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,810
...Diamond Joe Quimby.

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,816
Hey, I am no longer illiterate.

23
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,218
Now, why are we doomed to
this Quimby quagmire, you ask...

24
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:40,054
...O reasonable listener?

25
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,333
Because this town
is under the stranglehold...

26
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,986
...of a few tie-dyed "tree-huggers"...

27
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,299
...who'd rather play Hacky Sack
than lock up the homeless.

28
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:51,109
This sounds awfully controversial.

29
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:54,340
Lisa, you know I don't like
controversy in this house.

30
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:55,803
I don't like him either...

31
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:59,034
...but I'm doing a report on local politics
for my school project.

32
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:02,741
You think you're so big because
your class always gets to do projects.

33
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:08,660
Well, I'm doing a school project
on fireworks.

34
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:11,789
Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that.

35
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,517
Now, as a special sendoff
and a way to say...

36
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:20,259
...to our visiting Chinese principals...

37
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:23,320
...Bart Simpson has promised us
a fireworks display.

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,415
- Cool.
- Cool.

39
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:31,551
What a week.
He promise a big firework display.

40
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:34,952
- Bad student.
- Bad principal.

41
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,748
So, my friends, let's just junk
those dumb-o-crats...

42
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,333
...and their bleeding-heart
smell-fare program.

43
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:45,939
I had to listen to this jerk all morning.
Can we listen to something else?

44
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:49,476
When I'm driving the car,
I get to choose the radio station.

45
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:53,796
When you're driving,
we'll listen to your radio station.

46
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,939
I can't take this anymore.
Let's switch back.

47
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:04,272
Let's go to the phones.
First up is Bob from South Springfield.

48
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:06,381
- Welcome to you, sir.
- Hello, Birch.

49
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,422
Long-time listener, first-time caller.

50
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:13,082
Kudos for bringing the "public"
back to the Republican Party.

51
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:16,823
It's time people realized we conservatives
aren't all Johnny Hatemongers...

52
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:20,531
...and Charlie Bible-Thumps or even,
God forbid, George Bushes.

53
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,116
That sounds like Sideshow Bob.

54
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:28,252
Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob,
yakking it up on the old yak box.

55
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:32,469
I'll spare you the embarrassment of
admitting you don't know who Bob is.

56
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:36,177
Sideshow Bob used to be
Krusty the Clown's sidekick.

57
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:40,905
But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed
robbery, and Bart got him put in jail.

58
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:44,136
When he got out, he married Aunt Selma
and tried to murder her.

59
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,857
Oh, Sideshow Bob.

60
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,476
Bart, your mortal enemy is
on the radio.

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,544
It's time for more dementia
with Dr. Demento.

62
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:58,252
And now the Funny 5...

63
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:03,320
I meant your other mortal enemy.
Sideshow Bob.

64
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,905
Sideshow Bob?

65
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:09,102
I'm only 10, and I already got
two mortal enemies.

66
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:13,490
And this proposed expressway
will bring increased commerce...

67
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:15,156
...to our local merchants.

68
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:18,150
What's in it for us?

69
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,449
Give us something we like,
or we'll ride you out of town on a rail.

70
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:24,068
Well, what do you people like?

71
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:26,279
- Sleep.
- Sexy dames, and plenty of them.

72
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,714
Matlock!

73
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:35,420
Well, I suppose I could name it
the Matlock Expressway.

74
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:42,395
But it would be terribly myopic of me
to blame all my current woes...

75
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:46,133
...on one spiky-haired little simpleton.

76
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,969
Myopic or, to say the least,
intransigent.

77
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:51,406
Now, you mentioned
some woes there.

78
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:55,377
Well, you see, Birch,
I'm presently incarcerated.

79
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,284
Convicted of a crime
I didn't even commit.

80
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,588
Attempted murder.
Now, honestly, what is that?

81
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:08,025
Do they give a Nobel Prize
for attempted chemistry? Do they?

82
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:11,229
Oh, really.
Now, this is a personal call.

83
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:14,266
Now, my friends,
isn't this just typical?

84
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:19,171
Another intelligent conservative here
railroaded by our liberal justice system.

85
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:23,877
Just like Colonel Oliver North,
Officer Stacey Koon...

86
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,213
...and cartoon smokesperson
Joe Camel.

87
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:28,816
Well, I've had it.

88
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,588
I am gonna make it my mission
to see that our friend Bob is set free.

89
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:35,524
No!

90
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:40,162
Well, despite Bart's objections,
the people of South Africa...

91
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:42,532
...can now vote in free
democratic elections.

92
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,103
My friends, Bob is a political prisoner.

93
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,607
I want every loyal listener
to do everything they can...

94
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,576
...to get him out of jail.

95
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,111
All right, you heard the man.

96
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:55,714
One grenade each.

97
00:05:56,248 --> 00:06:01,187
Moe, I think he meant through
nonviolent, grassroots political action.

98
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:03,723
Oh, Jeez. Really? You think so?

99
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,094
All right, give them back. Come on.
Everybody, give them back.

100
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:09,630
Hey. Hey!
Who pulled the pin on this one?

101
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,470
Very well, if that is the way
the winds are blowing...

102
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:18,140
...let no one say I don't also blow.

103
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,608
Free Bob!

104
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:22,912
By special order of
the mayor of Springfield...

105
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,016
...you are hereby granted
a full and complete pardon.

106
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:30,221
Congratulations,
Robert Underdunk Terwilliger.

107
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:38,264
- Boat's on the other side.
- Yes, thank you.

108
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,490
Hail, brothers.

109
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:06,533
Now, then, gentlemen,
the mayoral campaign is upon us.

110
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,402
If we hope to defeat Joe Quimby...

111
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,672
...we need a candidate with
name recognition and media savvy.

112
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:14,876
A true leader
who will do exactly as he's told.

113
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,711
Monty, I'm way ahead of you.

114
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:21,050
If you'll just open that door,
you'll see the next mayor of Springfield.

115
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:26,523
Nice. Very nice.

116
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:31,095
- What did it say?
- No, no. Bob. Bob, come in.

117
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:35,367
A fine mahoq to you all.

118
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,935
Why, he's even better.

119
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,005
I agree. I like the human touch.

120
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:46,446
I want you on your best behavior
for this choreographed media event.

121
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:48,315
There is to be no wising off...

122
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:51,752
...no face-making and no grass-eating.
This means you, Ralph.

123
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,988
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, children.

124
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:55,223
Hello, Bart.

125
00:07:56,358 --> 00:08:00,729
Friends, my opponent, Joe Quimby,
is confused about your school system.

126
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:03,466
Do you know what he does?
He flip-flops.

127
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:11,609
Sometimes he doesn't know
whether he's coming or going.

128
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,250
He wants to sell your future short.

129
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:26,226
Bart, we can't let Bob
steal the spotlight.

130
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,996
We'll have to stoop
to the lowest common denominator.

131
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:30,197
I can do that.

132
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,936
Help! I'm being attacked by things.

133
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:38,974
Uncle Mayor was just saying
that us kids...

134
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:41,978
...are the most important
natural resource we have.

135
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:43,446
More important than coal?

136
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:46,383
Yes.

137
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,924
Oh, that was a big mistake, Bart.

138
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:55,760
No children have ever meddled
with the Republican Party...

139
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:57,429
...and lived to tell about it.

140
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,244
Stay out of Riverdale.

141
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,116
Without Mayor Quimby
Our town would really stink

142
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,821
We wouldn't have a tire yard
Or a mid-sized roller rink

143
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:22,358
We wouldn't have our gallows
Or a shiny Bigfoot trap

144
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:25,829
It's not the mayor's fault
That the stadium collapsed

145
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,899
Quimby. If you were running
for mayor, he'd vote for you.

146
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,935
Paid for by
the Mayor Quimby Committee.

147
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:34,873
Hey, four-eyes, vote Quimby.
Hey, beard-o, vote Quimby.

148
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,376
This time, he's the lesser of two evils.

149
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,745
Yeah, yeah, I love Grimby.

150
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,483
Could I have some more
bumper stickers, please, dude?

151
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,390
All right.

152
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,494
The mummy's ready
for his mystical journey.

153
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:57,399
What's happening?

154
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:01,155
Mayor Quimby supports
revolving-door prisons.

155
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:04,859
Mayor Quimby even released
Sideshow Bob...

156
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:08,263
...a man twice convicted
of attempted murder.

157
00:10:08,397 --> 00:10:11,200
Can you trust a man
like Mayor Quimby?

158
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:12,568
Vote Sideshow Bob for mayor.

159
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:19,843
The League of Uninformed Voters
presents the Springfield mayoral debates.

160
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,913
I'm your moderator, Larry King.
Now a word to our audience.

161
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:25,784
Even though we're being
broadcast on Fox...

162
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:28,587
...there's no need for obnoxious
hooting and hollering.

163
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:42,269
I shouldn't have shaken hands
with those old people.

164
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,311
I hope that flu doesn't affect
his performance out there.

165
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:52,014
Don't worry.
He's taken a million of these capsules.

166
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:01,292
Sideshow Bob,
Councilman Les Wynan...

167
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,729
...says that you're not
experienced enough to be mayor.

168
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:06,698
Sir, what do you have to say
about that?

169
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:12,505
I'd say that Les Wynan ought to do
more thinking and less whining.

170
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,612
- There's no Councilman Les Wynan.
- Good line, though.

171
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,651
Mayor Quimby, you are well known,
sir, for your lenient stance on crime.

172
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:27,255
But suppose for a second that
your house was ransacked by thugs...

173
00:11:27,422 --> 00:11:30,626
...your family tied up in the basement
with socks in their mouths.

174
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:34,230
You try to open the door,
but there's too much blood on the knob.

175
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:37,167
- What is your question?
- My question's about the budget.

176
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,187
I don't agree with
his Bart-killing policy...

177
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,358
...but I do approve of his
Selma-killing policy.

178
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,928
Well, he framed me
for armed robbery...

179
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:04,599
...but, man, I'm aching
for that upper-class tax cut.

180
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,075
And the results are in.
For Sideshow Bob, 100 percent.

181
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:14,544
For Joe Quimby, 1 percent.

182
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:17,314
And we remind you, there is
a 1-percent margin of error.

183
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:25,290
All right, let's go live
to Bob headquarters now...

184
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:27,793
...for Mayor Terwilliger's
victory speech.

185
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:43,144
And just look how happy he is.

186
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:55,627
It's the rapture!

187
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,431
Quick, get Bart out of the house
before God comes.

188
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:04,237
So sorry, Mr. Simpson.
Your house is blocking construction...

189
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:06,073
...of our new Matlock Expressway.

190
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:10,111
Now, I am a fair man.

191
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,313
You will have 72 hours to vacate.

192
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,051
At that time, we will blow up your house
and any remaining Simpsons.

193
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,354
Homer, we've got to stop them.

194
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:21,024
I know what you're up to,
Mayor Terwigager...

195
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,227
...and no one in my family's
gonna stand for it.

196
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,431
Move your goddurn house, son.

197
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:35,507
Bart, by special request of the mayor's
office, you are going to be left back.

198
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,911
You mean I have to repeat
the fourth grade?

199
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:42,749
Well, yes. But not for four or five years.
Bart, you're going to kindergarten.

200
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,685
Kindergarten?

201
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:49,223
Now, boys and girls,
who knows what this is?

202
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:51,759
- Triangle.
- Very good, Bart.

203
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:54,529
You have first choice of toys
for free play.

204
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,365
Cool. I call the Flintstone phone.

205
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,105
I like talking to you.

206
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:09,280
We're gonna lose our house and end up
living under a bridge like common trolls.

207
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,583
I don't think Bob
won that election legally.

208
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:14,453
I can't believe a convicted felon
would get so many votes...

209
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,755
...and another convicted felon
would get so few.

210
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,598
Here you go. The results
of last month's mayor election.

211
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:27,167
All 48,000 voters
and who each one of them voted for.

212
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,604
I thought this was a secret ballot.

213
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:39,315
Okay, Aaron A. Aaronson voted for...

214
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:41,084
...Bob.

215
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:43,620
Aaron L. Aaronson voted for...

216
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:45,622
...Bob.

217
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:48,826
Arthur B. Ablabab voted for...

218
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,762
...Bob.

219
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,015
Whoever wrote that note
wants to meet us here tonight?

220
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:11,753
This is so cool, Bart.
We're just like Woodward and Bernstein.

221
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,957
Except their dad wasn't waiting
in the car reading Archie Comics.

222
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,361
Stuck-up Riverdale punks.
Think they're too good for me.

223
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:23,133
You're on the right track.
Follow the names.

224
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,469
How the hell do you know?

225
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:32,310
I can't tell you who I am,
but I worked on the campaign.

226
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:36,181
Hey, Mr. Smithers!

227
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:39,519
Well, you might as well
give me a ride home now.

228
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:42,389
I've never gone
behind Mr. Burns' back before...

229
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:45,058
...but Sideshow Bob's
ultra-conservative views...

230
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:48,496
...conflict with my choice of lifestyle.

231
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:52,767
All I can do is give you one name.
Edgar Neubauer.

232
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:55,370
Find him, and you'll find your answer.

233
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,947
No Edgar Neubauer.

234
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:14,660
This is hopeless. They're gonna
demolish our house for sure.

235
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,062
We're gonna have to move
into a Motel 6.

236
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:20,133
But Dad can't afford 6 dollars a night.

237
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,104
Hey. Lis. Lis, come here. I found him.

238
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:25,772
I found Edgar Neubauer.

239
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:32,347
Oh, my God. The dead have risen,
and they're voting Republican.

240
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:35,183
No, Bart. Don't you see?
Dead people can't vote.

241
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:40,490
Look, "Prudence Goodwyfe.
Died, 1641."

242
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,425
She voted for Bob too.

243
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:45,662
So did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens,
and the Big Bopper.

244
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:49,333
Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob.

245
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:53,071
Look. Mr. And Mrs. Bananas,
Humphrey Boa-gart.

246
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:57,209
Oh, my poor dead kitty,
please, not you too.

247
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:02,115
All right, Bob, now it's personal.

248
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:05,485
Hey. He did try to kill me.

249
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:36,321
Mr. Mayor, is it true
you rigged the election?

250
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,391
No, I did not.

251
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,027
Kids, help.

252
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,997
Oh, I don't mind.

253
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:47,234
We want these children
to feel justice has been served.

254
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:53,475
That way, they can sleep soundly tonight
on their hard, feculent motel pillows.

255
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:58,013
Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am.

256
00:17:58,247 --> 00:18:01,584
I have a plan. I think we can trap him.

257
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:09,560
You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you
when you say you're innocent.

258
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:11,529
- Indeed, I am.
- Because we all know...

259
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:14,232
...you're a naive pawn,
puppet, if you will...

260
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,771
...of the most diabolical political genius
Springfield has ever known:

261
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:21,007
Birchibald T. Barlow!

262
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:25,080
Wait...

263
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:28,750
You don't have the intelligence to rig
an election by yourself, do you?

264
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:31,821
- You were just Barlow's lackey.
- You were Ronnie to his Nancy.

265
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:34,791
- Sonny to his Cher.
- Ringo to his rest of the Beatles.

266
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:39,997
Enough! Lies, lies! I did it! I did it all!

267
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:46,471
There. Is that what you want,
you smarmy little bastards?

268
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,041
- We want the truth.
- You want the truth?

269
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:53,212
You can't handle the truth.
No truth-handler, you.

270
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:57,617
I deride your truth-handling abilities.

271
00:18:57,818 --> 00:18:59,787
- Will you get to the point?
- Yes.

272
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:04,659
Only I could have executed such
a masterpiece of electoral fraud.

273
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:06,495
And I have the records to prove it.

274
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:12,201
Here, just look at these.
Each one a work of Machiavellian art.

275
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:18,909
- But why?
- Because you need me, Springfield.

276
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:22,580
Your guilty conscience may force you
to vote Democratic.

277
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:26,218
But deep down inside, you secretly long
for a cold-hearted Republican...

278
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:29,788
...to lower taxes, brutalize criminals
and rule you like a king.

279
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:33,526
That's why I did this.
To protect you from yourselves.

280
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,495
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a city to run.

281
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:41,802
- Bailiffs, place the mayor under arrest.
- What? Oh, yes, all that stuff I did.

282
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:46,041
Bart, we did it.
Now we get to keep our house...

283
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:48,677
...and you get to go
back to the fourth grade.

284
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:51,647
Tomorrow we were gonna find out
who the dish ran away with.

285
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:54,717
- The spoon, Bart.
- Of course.

286
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,126
Someday, I'll have my vengeance.

287
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:07,165
Someday, when I find my way out of
this savage, roach-ridden cesspool.

288
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,837
- Say, Terwilliger's a Yalie.
- Bob, come along.

289
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:15,108
We need an eighth to row
against the Princeton alums.

290
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:16,877
Princeton?

291
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:22,383
Stroke. Stroke.
