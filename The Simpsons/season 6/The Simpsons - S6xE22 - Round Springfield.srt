1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Round Springfield

2
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,846
Hey, kids, it's story time!

3
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:31,779
I'm gonna tell you the story
of Krusty's expensive new suit:

4
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,832
His sexual-harassment suit.

5
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,577
Oh, boy.

6
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:38,826
Anyway, as part of Krusty's
plea bargain...

7
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:40,973
...he has a new
court-ordered sidekick...

8
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,221
...Ms. No-Means-No.

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,483
You're hot. Let's get some dinner
after the show.

10
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:53,414
I have dinner with all my employees.
Right, Sideshow Mel?

11
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,414
We've never spoken outside of work.

12
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:02,241
I'm surprised he didn't blame
his problems on his Percodan addiction.

13
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:04,517
Wasn't my fault. It was the Percodan.

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,379
If you ask me,
that stuff rots your brain.

15
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:09,345
And now a word from my new sponsor.

16
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:12,448
Percodan?! Oh, crap!

17
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,621
Bart, are you ready
for your history test?

18
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:17,448
You bet, Mom. Ask me anything.

19
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:21,897
Okay. Who was
George Washington Carver?

20
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,138
The guy who chopped up
George Washington?

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,793
Really?

22
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:42,345
- Bart, you said you were going to study.
- My stomach.

23
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:46,621
- You just don't wanna take that test.
- No, I mean it. It really hurts.

24
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:48,448
Mom, I think he's serious.

25
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,345
Kids are so naive.

26
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,517
Lisa, when you get to be our age,
you'll learn a few things.

27
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:56,172
Like when a sign says,
"Do not feed the bears"...

28
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:58,655
...man, you'd better not
feed the bears.

29
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,759
Now, get to school, boy.

30
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:07,138
Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test.
I have a stomachache.

31
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:11,207
Well, that's a lame excuse
for an excuse.

32
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:14,724
Look, if you ignore me and I die,
you'll get in a lot of trouble.

33
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,414
Read page six of the school charter.

34
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:21,552
"No teacher shall be held accountable
if Bart Simpson dies."

35
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,759
We're also absolved if Milhouse
gets eaten by the school snake.

36
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:28,793
Hey, cool, there's a rabbit in here.

37
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:34,655
Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test.
Can I please go to the nurse?

38
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:36,655
Gosh, maybe you really are in pain.

39
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:40,517
Well, it would be cruel
not to let you go.

40
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:51,655
Now you may go.

41
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,931
Lunchlady Doris, why are you here?

42
00:02:56,138 --> 00:03:00,000
Budget cuts. They've even got
Groundskeeper Willie teaching French.

43
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:04,448
Bonjour, you cheese-eating
surrender monkeys.

44
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,931
Look, my stomach really hurts.

45
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:09,862
All I can give you are
these chewable Prozac for kids.

46
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:14,586
Your choice: Manic-Depressive Mouse
or the Bluebird of Unhappiness.

47
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:19,690
Superintendent Chalmers, meet
our new school nurse, Lunchlady Doris.

48
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:23,828
Nice to see you. Seymour, why is that
student lying unconscious on the floor?

49
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,414
Well, in many cases,
the floor is the best...

50
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,966
Oh, look, here comes Lumpy,
the school snake.

51
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:31,241
Help! Help!

52
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,517
Oh, Lord.

53
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,828
Don't worry, son. You'll be fine.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,862
This boy's appendix is inflamed
and about to burst...

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,931
...which will make it easier to find
once I get in there.

56
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:55,621
Man, these are primo seats.
I could really go for a hot dog.

57
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:57,897
Homer, this is an operation.

58
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,414
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!

59
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:06,207
Okay, Bart, I will count to three,
and you will be sound asleep.

60
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,034
One, two, three.

61
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,828
- Out like a light.
- Scalpel.

62
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:17,448
Maybe if I fiddle with these knobs.

63
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,241
Hey, I smell gas.

64
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:22,345
Pleasant gas.

65
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:25,310
Night-night gas.

66
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,241
How's my special little guy?

67
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:32,862
How you feeling, big brother?

68
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:35,931
Oh, this is wonderful. You're alive.

69
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:39,138
- No thanks to you, Homer.
- Why, you little...

70
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,862
Now, Homer, please. The boy's
just had a very serious operation.

71
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,172
Oh, right.

72
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:52,517
Now, Bart, I found the culprit:
A jagged, metal cereal O.

73
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:55,448
Wicked. I got this cool scar.

74
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:57,345
And I get to miss a week of school.

75
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,138
Dr. Hibbert, can I have
my appendix out?

76
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:06,966
Why not. Follow me, kids.

77
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,655
Nurse, prep these children.

78
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:13,759
I'm glad you're okay, Bart.

79
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,138
Bleeding Gums Murphy.

80
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:28,586
Little Lisa. It's good to see you again.

81
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,793
It's been a long time.

82
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:34,862
My friends call me Bleeding Gums.

83
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,862
How'd you get a name like that?

84
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:40,172
Let me put it this way.
You ever been to the dentist?

85
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:41,414
- Yeah.
- Not me.

86
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:46,621
I suppose I should go to one, but I
got enough pain in my life as it is.

87
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,552
- What are you here for?
- My brother just had his appendix out.

88
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,793
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks.

89
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:56,517
I'm doing my rounds,
and I'm a little behind.

90
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,759
He'll be fine.

91
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:05,055
Lisa, I sure am glad you dropped by.
You're the first visitor I've had.

92
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,917
- What about your family?
- I don't really have a family.

93
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:11,297
All I had was a little brother
who grew up to become a doctor.

94
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:15,297
He used to laugh
at the most inappropriate times.

95
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,986
I've got an older brother
that I'll never see.

96
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:21,745
He's a jazz musician or some such.
Oh, well. Bye-bye.

97
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:24,676
It must be awful to be
all alone in the world.

98
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,745
Well, I always had my music.

99
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:30,538
I learned at the feet
of Blind Willy Witherspoon.

100
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,676
I've been playing jazz for 30 years,
and I just can't make a go of it.

101
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,814
I want you to have my saxophone.

102
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:40,814
This isn't a saxophone,
it's an umbrella.

103
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,055
So I've played a umbrella
for 30 years?

104
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,641
Why didn't anybody tell me?

105
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:48,952
- We all thought it was funny.
- That's not funny.

106
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,676
Then I got my big break.
I was on Steve Allen's Tonight! Show.

107
00:06:55,434 --> 00:07:00,538
Now, a brilliant jazz musician who's
inspired me to do some improv poetry.

108
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,883
Twinkle, twinkle, groovy cat
How I wonder where you at

109
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:07,021
I really love the way you cook
Like me, when I wrote this book

110
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,607
How to Make Love to Steve Allen.

111
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,366
From the author of
Happiness Is a Naked Steve Allen...

112
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:16,366
...Journey to the Center of Steve Allen
and The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen.

113
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:19,917
I cut my first and only album,
Sax on the Beach.

114
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:25,124
But then I spent all my money
on my $ 1500-a-day habit.

115
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:28,676
I'd like another Fabergé egg, please.

116
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,848
- Sir, don't you think you've had enough?
- I'll tell you when I've had enough!

117
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,917
When was the last time you worked?

118
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,986
In '86, when I did a guest shot
on The Cosby Show.

119
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:45,503
Hey, kids. Meet Grandpa Murphy.

120
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,021
But we have three grandpas already.

121
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:50,503
This one is a great jazz musician.

122
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,331
They all are.

123
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:56,814
You see, the kids,
they listen to the rap music...

124
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:59,159
...which gives them the brain damage.

125
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:03,607
With their hipping and the hopping
and the bipping and the bopping.

126
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,641
So they don't know
what the jazz is all about.

127
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,986
You see, jazz is like
a Jell-O Pudding Pop.

128
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,090
No. Actually, it's more like Kodak film.

129
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:17,607
No. Actually, jazz is like
the New Coke.

130
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,366
It'll be around forever.

131
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:24,848
Wow, you've had some career.

132
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:28,848
Although the moral seems to be that
a life of jazz leaves you sad and lonely.

133
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:33,400
Well, before you came to visit,
I would have agreed with you.

134
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,228
This just in: Krusty the Clown staged
a press conference today...

135
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,710
...to defend himself against charges
that his products are unsafe...

136
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:44,641
...his theme park is a deathtrap...

137
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:49,055
...and that he's marketing videos
of Tonya Harding's wedding night.

138
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:51,297
I contend the tourists
were decapitated...

139
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:55,228
...before they entered the Krustyland
House of Knives. Next question.

140
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,676
What about that little boy who got
appendicitis from eating your cereal?

141
00:09:00,883 --> 00:09:05,641
To prove that this metal O is harmless,
I will personally eat one.

142
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,538
See? There's nothing...

143
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:15,262
Oh, boy!
This thing is shredding my insides!

144
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:19,297
Krusty, that wasn 't the metal one.
That was a regular Krusty-O.

145
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,055
It's poison.

146
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,124
- So you all set for your recital?
- I sure am. Look.

147
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:29,779
I stopped brushing my teeth
so I can play just like you.

148
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:35,021
Lisa, honey, music comes from what's
in your heart, not what's on your teeth.

149
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:36,952
Come on, let's jam.

150
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:35,124
Hey, Moe, what will you give me
for an A.A. Chip?

151
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:39,434
Barney, this is a five-minute chip.
It's worth a Pabst.

152
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,814
Baby, you are gonna
knock them dead.

153
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,641
Here, take this for luck.

154
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:54,710
Your sax! Thank you so much.

155
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:03,262
Now, I have learned that
most of the orchestra...

156
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:05,297
...is having their appendixes removed.

157
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:08,021
So without further ado,
I give you the remnants...

158
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:11,055
...of the Springfield Elementary School
orchestra.

159
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:15,193
On saxophone, Lisa Simpson.
On triangle, Martin Prince.

160
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:19,469
And with a flute up his nose,
Ralph Wiggum.

161
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,469
That's some nice fluting.

162
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,607
They'll play
"Stars and Stripes Forever."

163
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,883
Hopefully not forever.

164
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:33,124
This sucks.

165
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,297
Hey, Bleeding Gums, I was great!
And I owe it all to...

166
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:50,986
What happened to Mr. Murphy?

167
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:52,952
I'm sorry. He passed away.

168
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:08,641
Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?

169
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,986
Bleeding Gums was my hero,
and I never got to tell him how I felt.

170
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,434
Oh, I'm sure he knew.

171
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:17,469
And I'm sure that wherever he is now,
he's happy.

172
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:22,159
But he was the only person who had
the same love for music that I do.

173
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,193
Thank you.

174
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:28,090
Oh, Dad, why did he have to die?

175
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:32,538
Well, it's like the time that your cat,
Snowball, got run over.

176
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,228
- Remember, honey?
- Yeah.

177
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,952
What I'm saying is,
all we have to do...

178
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:40,021
...is go down to the pound
and get a new jazzman.

179
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,917
Oh, Dad!

180
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,676
I blew it again.

181
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,228
What?

182
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:54,400
Hey, Lis, you still upset
about that jazz guy?

183
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,917
If it helps,
I believe that after you die...

184
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,434
...you can come back
as whatever you want.

185
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,538
- I'll be a butterfly.
- How come?

186
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:08,366
Because nobody ever
suspects the butterfly.

187
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,641
I didn't burn down the school.

188
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:14,848
It was the butterfly, I tell you.
The butterfly!

189
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,159
He's crazy, boys. Get the Taser.

190
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:27,572
Maybe I need to talk to somebody
with a little more age and wisdom.

191
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:30,607
Death stalks you at every turn.

192
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:33,400
- Grampa.
- Well, it does.

193
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,228
There it is. Death!

194
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,710
It's only Maggie.

195
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:39,883
Oh, yeah.

196
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:44,745
You know, at my age,
the mind starts playing tricks. So...

197
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,262
- Death!
- That's only the cat.

198
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:51,366
- Death!
- That's Maggie again, Grampa.

199
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,779
Where were we? Death!

200
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,986
How come it won't stop hurting?

201
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:03,228
Lisa, it's normal to be sad
when a friend dies.

202
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,434
And Bleeding Gums
was a good friend to you.

203
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:08,986
But nobody is really gone
as long as we remember them.

204
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,469
If you really want to preserve
his memory...

205
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:16,434
...I recommend getting a tattoo.
It preserves the things you love.

206
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:20,090
"Starland Vocal Band"? They suck!

207
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,193
Death!

208
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:34,159
- Isn't anybody gonna show up?
- Well, Lisa, we've waited an hour.

209
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:38,400
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

210
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:41,366
...to bid farewell
to Blood and Guts Murphy...

211
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:44,503
No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.

212
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,366
Anyway, Bloody Gums Murphy
was quite the sousaphone player...

213
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:51,814
Saxophone! He was a jazz musician.

214
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:54,159
You didn't know him.
Nobody knew him.

215
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:55,779
But he was a great man.

216
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:58,676
And I won't rest
until all of Springfield...

217
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:01,538
...knows the name
Bleeding Gums Murphy.

218
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,297
And I won't rest
until I've gotten a hot dog.

219
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:05,952
Homer, this is a cemetery.

220
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:09,986
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!

221
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,503
What do you do,
follow my husband around?

222
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:16,055
Lady, he's putting my kids
through college.

223
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:20,359
Good news, Bart.
The Krusty-O Cereal Corp...

224
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,083
...has settled your case for $ 100,000,
less, of course, my legal fees.

225
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,772
What kind of legal fees?

226
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,600
Well, for a case this complex...

227
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:31,359
...I had to assemble
a crack team of lawyers.

228
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,566
Ronald Chaporo, trial attorney.

229
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:37,255
Albert Dershman, who can hold
three billiard balls in his mouth.

230
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:39,876
How much of the 100 thou do I get?

231
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:43,186
Five hundred dollars?

232
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:45,255
- Yes, well...
- Cool.

233
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:48,497
Glad you're happy. Let's roll.

234
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,307
I can't believe it. Five hundred bucks!

235
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,893
Just think what I can do
with that money.

236
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:00,962
Five hundred dollars on red.

237
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:03,583
The winner is black.

238
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,370
Cool.

239
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:10,129
I wanna honor Bleeding Gums' memory,
but I don't know where to start.

240
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,122
Maybe you could get the local
jazz station to do a tribute to him, huh?

241
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,384
Jazz. They just make it up
as they go along. I could do that.

242
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,485
- That's "Mary Had a Little Lamb."
- Okay, then this:

243
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:29,391
That's the same thing.
You just replaced "dees" with "do's."

244
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:34,022
I have a request. I'd like you to do
a tribute to Bleeding Gums Murphy.

245
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,874
I'd love to, little sister,
but we don't have his album.

246
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:39,055
- What if I could find it?
- I'd spin it.

247
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:40,800
But ain't no one gonna hear it.

248
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:42,780
Our broadcast range is only 23 feet...

249
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:46,471
...which makes us the most powerful
jazz station in the entire U.S. Of A.

250
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,485
Gee, your station has
a lot of problems.

251
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:51,068
Tell me about it.
Just look at our morning guy.

252
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:56,270
Hello. This is "Moleman in the Morning."
Good Moleman to you.

253
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:59,558
Today, part four of our series
of the agonizing pain...

254
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,679
...in which I live every day.

255
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:07,344
Two hundred and fifty dollars?

256
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:10,766
But I need that album to honor
the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy.

257
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,384
He's dead?
Well, why didn't you say so?

258
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,337
Where am I gonna get $500?

259
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,948
Now drive, Smithers. Drive.

260
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,572
Excuse me, my good man,
I have $500 to blow.

261
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:45,230
- What have you got?
- Behold the ultimate Pog.

262
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,820
I'll take it.

263
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,525
Lisa, look what I've got. Ta-da!

264
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:08,317
Bart, I can't believe it. But why?

265
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:11,572
When I said my stomach hurt,
you were the only one who believed me.

266
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,928
Oh, thank you. But $500...

267
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,377
You'll never see that much
money again.

268
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,592
Oh, yeah? Take a look at this.

269
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,632
I got the album.

270
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,223
Here. You can listen to it on this.

271
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,330
I did the best I could, Bleeding Gums.

272
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:01,095
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.

273
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:03,881
Poison-gas cloud heading for...

274
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:09,887
That's nice. Hey, it's getting cloudy.

275
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,605
Oh, boy.

276
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:26,062
That was for you, Bleeding Gums.

277
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:30,827
You've made
an old jazzman happy, Lisa.

278
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:35,290
You must avenge my death, Kimba.
I mean, Simba.

279
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,572
Luke, I am your father.

280
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,485
This is CNN.

281
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:43,277
Will you guys pipe down?
I'm saying goodbye to Lisa.

282
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:45,391
We're sorry.

283
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,404
I don't want you to go.

284
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,223
Sorry, but I have to. Goodbye.

285
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,277
Goodbye.

286
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,055
Oh, what the heck.
Once more, from the top.

287
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:08,545
One more time!

288
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:10,491
Oh, come on, Lisa.

289
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:13,075
I got a date with Billie Holiday.
