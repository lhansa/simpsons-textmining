1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,957
Lisa's Wedding

2
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:41,037
Zounds! I did thee mightily smitely.

3
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,373
"Zounds" is a Renaissance English word,
short for "God's wounds"...

4
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,755
...but "smitely," that's pure Flanders.

5
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:51,172
Please call a doctor.

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,984
- These Renaissance fairs are so boring.
- Oh, really? Did you see the loom?

7
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:00,433
I took loom in high school.

8
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:15,433
Yon meat 'tis sweet
as summer's wafting breeze.

9
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:18,084
- Can I have some?
- Mine ears are open to the pleas...

10
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,131
...of those who speak ye old English.

11
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,688
Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now
my boon, that I might sup...

12
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,541
...upon suckling pig this noon.
- Whatever.

13
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:30,635
I've eaten eight different meats.
I'm a true Renaissance man.

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,675
I'll go to the first-aid tent and tell them
to plug in ye old stomach pump.

15
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:42,581
Alight your gaze
on yonder fabled beasts of yore.

16
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:48,990
Behold the rarest of the rare...

17
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:53,487
...the mythological two-headed hound,
born with only one head.

18
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:57,849
And here, out of the mists of history,
the legendary esquilax:

19
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:03,017
A horse with the head of a rabbit
and the body of a rabbit.

20
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:05,870
It's galloping away.

21
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:07,816
Here, bunny-bunny. Here, bunny.

22
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,192
Here, "esquilax."

23
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,856
I've been waiting for you, Lisa.

24
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,809
- How did you know my name?
- Your nametag.

25
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,172
Would you like to know your future?

26
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:34,359
Sorry, I don't believe in fortunetelling.
I should go.

27
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,312
What's your hurry? Bart, Maggie
and Marge are at the joust.

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,796
And Homer is heckling
the puppet show.

29
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:42,917
Wow, you can see into the present.

30
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:46,037
Now we'll see what the future holds.

31
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,430
- The death card?
- No, that's good.

32
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:53,584
It means transition, change.

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,235
That's cute.

34
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:57,611
The happy squirrel.

35
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,188
- That's bad?
- Possibly.

36
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:01,705
The cards are vague and mysterious.

37
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:05,329
They seem to be revealing
the story of your first love.

38
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,007
Do you want me to continue?

39
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:10,195
- Guess so.
- It's...

40
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:12,846
It's coming to me. Yes.

41
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:16,839
I see an eastern university
in the year 2010.

42
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,631
The world has become
a very different place.

43
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:33,786
I can't wait to see that play.

44
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,940
- Hey, watch it.
- Watch it.

45
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:51,772
That man is instantly the most
annoying person I've ever met.

46
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,423
A soy-based snack
will calm me down.

47
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,745
Him again.

48
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:18,215
Hello. I need Ecosystem of the Marsh
by Thompson.

49
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,638
The last copy was just signed out by...

50
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:23,383
...Hugh Parkfield.

51
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,061
Oh, there he is.

52
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,108
No. It couldn't be.

53
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,806
Thanks for holding my book
while I tied my shoe.

54
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:36,564
That's the book I need.
You'll probably take forever with it too.

55
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:39,115
- I read faster.
- I read at a 78th-grade level.

56
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,994
Right here.

57
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,604
- Finished this page?
- Ages ago.

58
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:49,618
- I'll get the dictionary.
- Why?

59
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:52,604
- You'll see. "Stochastic."
- Pertaining to a process...

60
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:56,296
...involving a randomly determined
sequence of observations.

61
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:03,645
First, they hate each other.
All of a sudden, they love each other.

62
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,470
- Oh, it doesn't make any sense to me.
- Of course not. You're a robot.

63
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:20,289
I never met anyone who so understood
the magic of Jim Carrey.

64
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:23,947
He can make you laugh with no more
than a frantic flailing of his limbs.

65
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:27,101
I can't believe how much
we have in common.

66
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:30,859
We're studying the environment, we're
utterly humorless about vegetarianism.

67
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,403
And we both love the Rolling Stones.

68
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,262
Yes. Not for their music
but for their tireless efforts...

69
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,175
...to preserve historic buildings.

70
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,390
Lisa, I can't bear being apart
all summer.

71
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,068
Come with me to Parkfield Manor.

72
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:45,625
I'd love to. Can we get vegetarian meals
at your parents' house?

73
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,537
- Yes, we can, Lisa.
- That is good.

74
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:50,423
- Because eating animals is wrong.
- So very wrong.

75
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:54,685
- When will the world learn?
- I don't know. I just don't know.

76
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:58,376
I love these new planes.

77
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:01,766
Yes. It's a good thing they re-evaluated
those wacky old designs.

78
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,229
- Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield.
- Thank you.

79
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:18,712
They were made
for the finest family in Britain.

80
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:21,430
I don't know
how we ended up with them.

81
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:25,490
Should I laugh? Was that dry
British wit or subtle self-pity?

82
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:27,403
They're staring at me. Better respond.

83
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:33,477
It's good to hear
a boisterous American laugh.

84
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:37,370
And I love that painting. Judging
by the clothes, I'd say 17th century.

85
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,953
Actually, Lisa, it's just Uncle Eldred.

86
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:44,249
I get me brain medicines
from the National Health.

87
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:49,517
This place is so enchanting, Hugh.
I love it here.

88
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:51,766
I wanted this to be perfect for you.

89
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,450
I know you Americans
like everything to be...

90
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:56,296
...fireworks.

91
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,551
Oh, blast. Go to plan B.

92
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:15,222
Yes, I will.

93
00:07:18,242 --> 00:07:19,853
Isn't it wonderful?

94
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:24,886
Master Hugh has found a true love.

95
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,772
- Hi, Mom.
- Lisa. Hello.

96
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,061
How are you doing in England?
Remember, an elevator is a "lift"...

97
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,953
...a mile is called a "kilometer,"
and botulism is "steak-and-kidney pie."

98
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:46,101
Guess what.
Hugh and I are getting married.

99
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:50,430
All right! Lisa, that's wonderful.

100
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,121
If only your father was still with us.

101
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,537
But he left for work a few minutes ago.

102
00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:00,967
Remember we'd always plan my dream
wedding, and you always promised...

103
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:05,161
...to, you know, well,
keep Dad from ruining it?

104
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:09,088
Oh, don 't worry, honey.
I guarantee your father will behave.

105
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,739
- Mom, it's a Picturephone.
- Oh, this? This?

106
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:14,188
Oh, no. I just got
a touch of the rheumatiz.

107
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,906
Mom, Picturephone.

108
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,336
Hi, Mom.
Oh, that's great news about Lisa.

109
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,383
Well, listen, I better get back to work.

110
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:27,779
They're finally paying me for this.

111
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:32,812
Oh, yeah.

112
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:43,953
Yes, but the international market
is my focus.

113
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,410
Oh, Marge, that's great news.

114
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,994
Hey, hey, there
with the personal calls, Simpson.

115
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,752
But, Mr. Milhouse,
my little girl's getting married.

116
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:55,262
Lisa?

117
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,081
My one true love.

118
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:02,779
It's not you, Milhouse.
I just don't plan to ever get married.

119
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:12,141
I think I'll write your performance
evaluation now, Simpson.

120
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,658
I gotta call everyone
and tell them the good news.

121
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,202
What the...?

122
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,685
Maggie, I need to use the phone.

123
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,042
Will that girl ever shut up?

124
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,297
I'll plan everything.
We can have the reception at Moe's.

125
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:34,686
Why not have the whole wedding there.
We'll do it on a Monday morning.

126
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:37,639
- There'll be fewer drunks.
- Don't take this personally.

127
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:41,029
I've obtained a court order to prevent
you from planning this wedding.

128
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:42,505
"Whereas Homer Simpson..."

129
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:45,391
Well, these seem to be in order.
I'll be in the hammock.

130
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,492
"Mr. Smithers plus guest."

131
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:53,176
There's only one person
I'd wanna bring.

132
00:09:56,532 --> 00:10:00,525
Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out
the second they discover the cure...

133
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:03,344
...for 17 stab wounds in the back.
How we doing, boys?

134
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:05,324
Well, we're up to 15.

135
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:18,831
We're invited to the wedding of our
only graduate to read at an adult level.

136
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:20,408
It must be Lisa Simpson.

137
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:24,066
Of course, Martin Prince perished
in that science-fair explosion.

138
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:27,623
Not quite perished, my lady love.

139
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,475
Although some days I wish I had.

140
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,616
Hey, I remember you.
Mayor Quimby, right?

141
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:50,542
No. Look at this license.
I'm Mohamed Jafar.

142
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:54,200
Quimby, after this fare, get your
indicted ass to the convention center.

143
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:56,582
I cut the ribbon
at that convention center.

144
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:03,596
Just a couple more blocks
to my house.

145
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:09,864
Darling, don't worry. I'm sure
I'll get along with your family.

146
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:11,475
You prepared me for the worst.

147
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:13,723
As long as they're not
squatting in a ditch...

148
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,871
...poking berries up their noses.

149
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,918
And if they are?

150
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:20,972
Here they come. Raise the flag.

151
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,978
- Oh, Lisa.
- Yo, Hugh.

152
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,529
Here's a little bit of U.S. Hospitality.

153
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,509
What do you think of that?

154
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:35,267
Dad!

155
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:38,690
Now throw compost on it.

156
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,596
Enjoy.

157
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,348
Still warm.

158
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,616
You can be the first to try out
the new guest bedroom I built.

159
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,844
If the building inspector comes by,
it's not a room, it's a window box.

160
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,730
Oh, Hugh, thank you.

161
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:05,482
You've been just wonderful
through this entire ordeal.

162
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,905
Lisa, I love you so much.
I'm willing to go through anything.

163
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:14,341
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, Lisa.

164
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,858
Fortunately, the compost heap
broke my fall.

165
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:18,670
Be a dear, run a bath.

166
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:25,113
Homer, Bart, Maggie,
company eating rules.

167
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,193
Oh, right.

168
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:33,032
Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life
than just the wrecking ball.

169
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,247
I also crush cars into cubes.

170
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:37,730
On the side,
I promote local tough-man contests.

171
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:40,784
I'm getting out all my aggression
till I go to law school.

172
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:43,770
So, Hugh, have you heard
all the latest American jokes?

173
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:46,220
Here's a good one. Pull my finger.

174
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:48,871
Yes, we have that one in England too.

175
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:50,683
I said, pull my finger.

176
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:53,468
Mom, we've got my wedding-dress
fitting this afternoon.

177
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:56,388
Maggie, if you're not doing anything,
why don't you come.

178
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:58,569
Maggie, don't talk
with your mouth full.

179
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:01,220
Me and Bart will take Hugh
out this afternoon.

180
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:03,569
Hugh should take it easy
because of his fall.

181
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:06,388
The only thing bruised in that fall
was my spine.

182
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,334
- I'll be delighted.
- Great.

183
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:10,918
- There's only one thing I ask in return.
- Certainly.

184
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,126
Pull my finger.

185
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,952
So this driving on the left makes you
feel more at home, huh, Hugh?

186
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:22,831
And tonight, the following
celebrities have been arrested:

187
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,113
Heather Locklear Fortensky
remains at large.

188
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,441
Remember, if you see any celebrities,
consider them dangerous.

189
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,522
You know, I rather like this pub.

190
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,670
An English boy, eh?

191
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:36,052
You know,
we saved your ass in World War II.

192
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:38,200
Well, we saved your ass
in World War III.

193
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,790
- That's true.
- There's something I want you to have.

194
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,945
My dad gave me his cuff links to wear
on the day I married Marge.

195
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:48,770
They brought us good luck.
I couldn't imagine a happier marriage.

196
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:51,455
We don't have many traditions
in our family.

197
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:56,119
But it would mean a lot to me
if you kept this one alive.

198
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:58,066
Well, I'd be honored...

199
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:02,160
...to wear those things.

200
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:08,670
You know, Fox turned into
a hardcore-sex channel so gradually...

201
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:10,582
...I didn't even notice.

202
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:14,945
It's so great to have the whole family
together under one roof.

203
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,059
I never realized how much I missed it.

204
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:22,797
Listen to the murmurs in the next room.
The house is full of life again.

205
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:25,213
Keep it down in there!

206
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,227
All right, Dad.

207
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:29,978
I'm sorry I left you alone
with Homer and Bart.

208
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:32,529
No, no, honey. We had a fine time.

209
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,482
- How'd you get that gash?
- When we hid in the Dumpster...

210
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,307
...after the fire alarm went off
in the pornographic-magazine warehouse.

211
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:41,556
You are so good
to put up with all of this.

212
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:43,905
Oh, don't be silly, Lisa.

213
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:46,321
Everything's fine. Really.

214
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:49,878
Now, go to sleep. We have a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

215
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:52,999
A big, long day.

216
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:02,764
Lisa, I can't believe
it's your wedding day already.

217
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:06,925
Mom, I feel kind of funny wearing white.
I mean, Milhouse.

218
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:08,468
Oh, Milhouse doesn't count.

219
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:15,750
Okay, I've got something old,
that's my pearl necklace.

220
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:17,562
Something new is the wedding dress.

221
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,817
Something borrowed is this antique
brooch from Hugh's mother.

222
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,663
Now I just need something blue.

223
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:27,428
- Here.
- Oh, Mom, thanks.

224
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:41,690
Wow, Lisa. Looking at you makes me
wanna get married for a third time.

225
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,744
I met a really nice exotic dancer
at Hugh's bachelor party.

226
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,133
- Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
- We had one in his honor.

227
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,750
I had one in his honor.

228
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:53,603
I went to a strip club.

229
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:56,858
Well, here goes nothing.

230
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,522
Mum, Dad...

231
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:03,267
...meet Homer Simpson.

232
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:05,012
- How do you do?
- Hey. How are you?

233
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,824
Nice to meet you.

234
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,254
You know what's great
about you English?

235
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,844
Octopussy. Man, I must have
seen that movie...

236
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,086
...twice.

237
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:20,650
Yes. Yes. That's not too bad.

238
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:25,796
Smithers, take me home.
I'm not fully defrosted.

239
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:28,313
Nonsense. Just sit down
and rest for a moment.

240
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:30,259
There you go.

241
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,615
Oh, no. We've got
a little situation here.

242
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:36,199
I can't feel anything
below my cummerbund.

243
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,662
- Hi, Dad.
- You look great, sweetheart.

244
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,084
- Thanks.
- Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson.

245
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:47,642
I always felt you were the best thing
my name ever got attached to.

246
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:51,735
Since you learned to pin your own
diapers, you've been smarter than me.

247
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:54,454
- Oh, Dad.
- No, no. Let me finish.

248
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:57,071
I want you to know
I've always been proud of you.

249
00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:00,326
You're my greatest accomplishment,
and you did it all yourself.

250
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:02,742
You helped me understand
my own wife better...

251
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,467
...and taught me to be a better person.
But you're also my daughter.

252
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:09,386
I don't think anybody could've had
a better daughter...

253
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,675
- Dad, you're babbling.
- See? You're still helping me.

254
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,574
Hey, Dad, did you forget to give
those cuff links to Hugh?

255
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:20,158
- No.
- Well?

256
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,836
I found them on the nightstand.

257
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:24,252
I guess they weren't his cup of tea.
Don't worry.

258
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,568
But you've been going on
about these all week.

259
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:28,548
I'm sure he just forgot.

260
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:32,709
Lisa, we're not supposed to see
each other before the wedding.

261
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:35,863
- It's tradition.
- What about my family's tradition?

262
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:39,890
Surely you don't want me to wear those
in front of my parents and their friends.

263
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:43,346
- But you promised my dad you would.
- I was just humoring him.

264
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:46,366
- Actually, he frightens me a bit.
- I know they look silly...

265
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,615
...but his feelings will be hurt.

266
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:50,460
Fine.

267
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:53,816
I must say, you were right.
This has been quite trying.

268
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:56,870
I've attempted to enjoy your family
on a personal level...

269
00:17:57,037 --> 00:18:00,964
...on an ironic level, as a novelty,
as camp, as kitsch...

270
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:03,917
...as cautionary example.
Nothing works.

271
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,272
When we get back to England,
we won't have to deal with them.

272
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,420
You saying we won't
see my family again?

273
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,071
Your mother will come
when the children are born.

274
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:15,460
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
I don't wanna cut my family out.

275
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,514
Really? Lisa, you're better
than this place.

276
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,829
You're like a flower
that grew out of dirt.

277
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,581
- That's a horrible thing to say.
- Oh, come on.

278
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:28,044
- You complain more than anyone.
- Maybe, but I still love them.

279
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:31,735
And I don't think you understand that.

280
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,682
And now, to sing "Amazing Grace"...

281
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:40,997
...Miss Maggie Simpson.

282
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:44,454
She's quite a hellion,
but does have an incredible voice.

283
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:49,454
Stop everything.
The wedding has been called off.

284
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,246
This is very sad news.

285
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:02,843
It never would've happened if the
wedding was in the church with God...

286
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:06,635
...instead of out here
in the cheap showiness of nature.

287
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:08,749
Who wants cake?

288
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,051
The next day, Hugh goes back to
England, and you never see him again.

289
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:33,413
Now that I know, isn't there any way
to change the future?

290
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:35,997
No. But try to look surprised.

291
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:38,178
You said you'd tell me
about my true love.

292
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,460
Oh, you'll have a true love.

293
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:43,111
But I specialize in foretelling
the relationships...

294
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,125
...where you get jerked around.

295
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:02,197
Lisa, where were you?
You missed the most incredible thing.

296
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:06,157
- Hi, Dad.
- I ate seven pounds of fudge.

297
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,244
The man at the stand said
it was a record.

298
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,721
What else did you do, Dad?

299
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:14,311
I rode the tea cups. Then I got
a little sick, and I had to sit down.

300
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,526
But then I rode them again.
