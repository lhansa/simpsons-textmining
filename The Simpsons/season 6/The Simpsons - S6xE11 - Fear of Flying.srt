1
00:00:00,438 --> 00:00:00,438
Fear of Flying

2
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:49,507
Hey, Moe, you got change for a 5?

3
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,748
Yeah, sure thing, Lenny.

4
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:56,162
A snake in the cash register!

5
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:59,472
Yeah, great prank, fellas. Great.

6
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:03,990
- Oh, I'm gonna be sick tonight.
- Hey, Moe, you wanna smell my flower?

7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,369
Do I!

8
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:10,369
I'm burning up here!

9
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:14,472
Taking advantage
of my alcohol-soaked clothes.

10
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,507
Oh, it's funny and it makes you think.

11
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:22,610
I need some coffee before I black out.
Homer, pass me the sugar.

12
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,300
This is gonna be great.

13
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,128
- Oh, there's sugar all over the bar now.
- That's not funny, Homer.

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,403
Yeah. We were just messing around,
and you had to go too far.

15
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:40,576
How many people want Homer
banned from this place for life?

16
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:43,300
- Yeah!
- Come on, everybody.

17
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,506
This bar is like a tavern to me.

18
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:49,266
Sorry, Homer. You should've thought of
that before giving me the sugar-me-do.

19
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:52,990
I'm taking your caricature down
from Mount Lushmore...

20
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:57,403
...and I'm pulling your favorite song
out of the jukebox.

21
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,369
- "It's Raining Men"?
- Yeah, not no more it ain't.

22
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,748
Joke's on them. I'm still alive.

23
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:15,576
Cheer up, Homer.

24
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,196
- Can't.
- Okay.

25
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,886
What if you pretended
that this couch were a bar?

26
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:23,197
Then you could spend more nights
at home with us.

27
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:26,334
I am not going to dignify that
with an answer.

28
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:27,852
Look on the bright side, Dad.

29
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,472
Did you know the Chinese
use the same word for crisis...

30
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:34,369
...as they do for opportunity?
- Yes. "Cris-a-tunity."

31
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,507
You're right. I've been wasting
my life away in that dump for years.

32
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,817
That's it. I'm going to find
a new bar to drink in.

33
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:45,679
And I'm gonna get drunker
than I've ever been in my entire life.

34
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,714
Bart, where's my wallet?

35
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:50,197
- Right here, Dad.
- Thank you.

36
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:59,300
- Wow, classy.
- Good evening, sir.

37
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,955
Would you please leave
without a fuss right now?

38
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:04,576
Okay.

39
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,541
This looks like a nice, friendly place.

40
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,852
Sammy, you're too old
to go on a date with two twins...

41
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,714
...on the same night you're supposed to
marry Diane without Rebecca knowing.

42
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:23,886
I'll make you a bet. If this affects my
major-league comeback, I'll sell the bar.

43
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,955
Woody, give me a beer.

44
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,403
I think you've had enough,
Mr. Peterson.

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,334
My chiropractor says
I can't carry you home anymore.

46
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,059
Just give me another beer,
you brain-dead hick.

47
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:37,231
I'll kill you. I'll kill all of you!

48
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,576
Settle down, Normie.
Gotta save those pipes for karaoke.

49
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,369
I love you guys.

50
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,369
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,955
There's something bothering me
about this place.

52
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:06,231
I know. This lesbian bar
doesn't have a fire exit!

53
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:10,645
- Enjoy your deathtrap, ladies.
- What was her problem?

54
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:16,852
Greetings, good man.
Might I trouble you for a drink?

55
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:21,093
- Oh, get out of here, Homer.
- Homer? Who is Homer?

56
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,886
My name is Guy Incognito.

57
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:34,610
Oh, my God.
This man is my exact double.

58
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,921
That dog has a puffy tail!

59
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,197
Here, Puff. Here, Puff.

60
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,507
The last bar in Springfield.

61
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:53,399
If they don't let me in here,
I'm gonna have to quit drinking.

62
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:55,883
Shut up, liver!

63
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,567
My liver hurts.

64
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:06,755
- I'd like a beer, please.
- Sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink here.

65
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:09,507
- But I am a pilot.
- Where's your uniform?

66
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:13,265
I stowed it safely
in the overhead compartment.

67
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:17,829
- Well, you talk the talk. Here's a loaner.
- We need a pilot, pronto.

68
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,258
- Who wants to fly to the Windy City?
- I'll go! Me! I'm your man!

69
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:23,836
Conditions are a bit windy.

70
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,185
Well, on second thought,
maybe I'll sit down.

71
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,265
- You.
- But I...

72
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:32,023
You're not just impersonating
a pilot so you can drink here, are you?

73
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,883
Yeah. That's exactly why I'm here.

74
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,232
You flyboys. You crack me up.

75
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,916
But I keep telling you, I'm not a pilot.

76
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:43,634
And I keep telling you
you flyboys crack me up!

77
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:47,426
- Hi, I'm Alan. I'm your copilot.
- Yeah...

78
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,607
As a change of pace...

79
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:53,802
...I'm gonna let you do most of the
work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.

80
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:58,668
And I'll just get us started.

81
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:04,205
We'll need that to live.

82
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:16,419
If word gets out about this, Crazy Clown
Airlines will be a laughingstock.

83
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:18,399
In exchange for your silence...

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,560
...I'm prepared to offer your family free
tickets to anywhere in the United States.

85
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,607
Excluding Alaska and Hawaii,
the freak states.

86
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,668
Good news, everybody.
Because I endangered lives...

87
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:30,446
...we can fly anywhere we want.

88
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:31,990
- Alaska!
- Hawaii!

89
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:35,044
I don't know, Homer.

90
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,930
We're right in the middle
of the busy housekeeping season.

91
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:41,319
But, Marge, you deserve a vacation.

92
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,044
It's a chance for you to clean up
after us in a whole other state.

93
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,876
But getting on a plane like that seems
like a hassle coupled with a burden.

94
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,232
Come on, Marge. I wanna shake off
the dust of this one-horse town.

95
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:56,822
I wanna explore the world. I wanna
watch TV in a different time zone.

96
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,017
I wanna visit strange, exotic malls.
I'm sick of eating hoagies.

97
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:05,279
I want a grinder, a sub, a footlong hero.
I wanna live, Marge!

98
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:10,010
Won't you let me live?
Won't you, please?

99
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:18,903
So, Marge, pretty sweet, eh?

100
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,386
Oh, I forgot to clean
the lint basket in the dryer.

101
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:25,044
If someone broke into the house
and did laundry, it could start a fire.

102
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:32,560
Oh, great. I specifically asked
not to be seated next to a baby.

103
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:37,527
We must be really flying high.

104
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:41,117
Those people down there
look all tiny and blurry.

105
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,634
Just like the inside of a cataract.

106
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:45,044
Attention, passengers.

107
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:50,178
Due to our policy of overselling flights,
this flight has been oversold.

108
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:52,493
In accordance with FAA rules...

109
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:57,393
...the first two people to the front
will be upgraded to first class.

110
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,258
Okay, you two.

111
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:04,607
Come on, Bart,
they're gonna pamper us.

112
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:07,493
Not literally, of course.

113
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:15,279
I come for the service...

114
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:19,440
...but I stay for the legroom.

115
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:25,547
Flight crew, prepare for takeoff.

116
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:31,285
I think I'll go get a picture
of the plane taking off.

117
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:35,044
Marge, what's wrong?
Are you hungry? Sleepy? Gassy?

118
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:40,279
- Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?
- Homer, I never told you this before...

119
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:42,795
...but I'm not a good flier.

120
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:49,708
I have to get off the plane.
Let me off the plane.

121
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,762
I'm asking you nicely
to open the doors.

122
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,950
Take it easy, Marge.
How about if we dope you up real good?

123
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:58,601
Let me off! Let me off! Let me off!

124
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:09,037
It's okay, Marge,
we don't need to go on a trip.

125
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:13,332
We'll just wait for the killer bees
to come to us.

126
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:18,291
You know, I have this feeling
that we forgot something.

127
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,183
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Mom, are you feeling any better?

128
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:32,015
- Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
- Permit me to solve the mystery.

129
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,096
Your mother has a fear of flying.

130
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:37,754
So much for the days when I could say,
"At least my mother's normal."

131
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:41,076
- Everybody's got a fear of something.
- Not everybody.

132
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,364
- Sock puppets.
- Where?! Where?!

133
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,613
Mom, are you sure
you don't want to discuss it?

134
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,398
Sure as sugar.

135
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:57,687
Lisa, the important thing is for your
mother to repress what happened...

136
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:02,418
...push it deep down inside her
so she'll never annoy us again.

137
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:05,103
If we don't encourage her
to vent her feelings...

138
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,049
...they can come out in other ways.

139
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,103
I just realized we never had
a wedding for the cat and the dog.

140
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:12,452
They've been living in sin.

141
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:24,532
Mom, you've been cooking all night?

142
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:28,391
Judge, jury and executioner
all rolled into one, you are.

143
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,177
See, Dad?
I told you Mom would have problems.

144
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:36,076
No, no, honey, it's all right.
Really, I'm fine. I'm all right.

145
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,532
Mother always said don't complain.
Be good. Behave. Behave.

146
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,317
Be nice. Smile. Be polite.
Don't make waves.

147
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:46,848
You heard your mother's ramblings.
She's fine, so behave.

148
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,532
Marge, it's 3 a.m.

149
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:58,291
- Shouldn't you be baking?
- In a little while.

150
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:01,613
Mom, can we talk to you?

151
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:05,203
Can't talk. Keeping myself
in a state of catlike readiness.

152
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,123
Neat.

153
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:10,640
Anyway, Mom,
maybe you should go into therapy.

154
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,962
No, I don't need therapy.
I'm fine. And it's too expensive.

155
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,980
And I don't believe in it.
It breaks up families.

156
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:20,338
It turns wives against husbands,
children against fathers...

157
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,713
...neighbors against me.

158
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:25,640
You don't have to pay some
fancy psychiatrist 10 bucks an hour...

159
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,720
...to get top-notch therapy.

160
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,767
Hello. Radio Psychic.

161
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,821
You will die a terrible, terrible death.

162
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,606
I'm sorry. That was our last caller.

163
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:37,955
Okay, I'm getting something now.

164
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:41,848
Okay. You will die
a terrible, terrible death.

165
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,096
- But...
- Thank you for calling Radio Psychic.

166
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:46,579
- Do you have a song request?
- "It's Raining Men."

167
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:50,571
Now, Marge, "Dear Abby" says...

168
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:53,962
...seeing films about air travel
can calm your fears.

169
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,740
Here are some upbeat titles.

170
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:58,492
Hero. Fearless.

171
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,338
Alive!

172
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:04,096
No thanks to the plane,
many of us are still...

173
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,277
...alive!
- Alive!

174
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,693
We certainly are.

175
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,015
Pass me another hunk of copilot.

176
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:13,658
Dad, Mom's getting worse.

177
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:17,250
You have to take her to see a real
psychiatrist. Look how tense she is.

178
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:18,928
She's fine.

179
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:29,801
All right, Lisa, you got your way.
Your mom's going to a psychiatrist.

180
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:32,854
She's gonna tell Marge to leave me.
It'll break up the family.

181
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:35,707
You'll have to live with
your grandmother and pick beans.

182
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:37,989
Dad, I like picking beans
with Grandma.

183
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:40,606
- Well, keep it up, then.
- Okay, I will.

184
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,224
- Good. You do that.
- Fine.

185
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,653
- You'll be picking many a bean.
- Hope I do.

186
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:51,143
I don't believe it! Principal Skinner.

187
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:52,787
Well, well, well.

188
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:58,224
- I never thought I'd win this easy.
- This has nothing to do with you.

189
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:02,653
I have many, many issues
with my beloved smother... Mother.

190
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:05,036
Leave that man alone
with his pain and sit down.

191
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:06,579
Okay.

192
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,250
All right, how much do you charge?

193
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,304
If money is a problem,
I charge on a sliding scale.

194
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:17,284
I can go as low as $30 an hour.

195
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:20,338
- Keep sliding.
- Thirty dollars will be fine.

196
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:24,197
First, what are your qualifications?

197
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,177
Well...

198
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:29,767
Oh, no.
I'm not here to take a reading test.

199
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:32,083
I wanna see some credentials.

200
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:35,841
I'm sorry, doctor. He's just afraid
you'll blame all my problems on him.

201
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:37,955
I'm not here to blame anyone.

202
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,089
Marge, therapy can be
an intense process.

203
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,269
We'll go deep into your subconscious...

204
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:51,546
...and we're not going to stop until we've
exposed the root of your fear of flying.

205
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:55,705
Don't worry.
This is a private sanctuary...

206
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,901
...where whatever transpires
will be just between us.

207
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,928
Oh, that's just Murray the window
washer. He comes every day at 12:00.

208
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:07,217
But it's a few seconds before 12:00.

209
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:15,058
Ever since you started therapy,
all you can do is talk about yourself.

210
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,105
Well, what about me, Marge?

211
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,595
I just left my first session.
I haven't even opened my mouth yet.

212
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:24,521
You see? You see?
"I just left my first session...

213
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:27,977
...and I haven't opened
my mouth yet."

214
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,467
Marge, there's no simple explanation
for your fear of flying...

215
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,789
...but it can probably be traced
to some childhood trauma.

216
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,165
Think back.

217
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:40,360
What's the earliest memory you have
of something bad happening?

218
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:44,890
That would have to be
my first day of school.

219
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:49,521
They got this thing called a fire drill.

220
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:53,246
They use it to drill a flaming hole
in your head.

221
00:14:55,326 --> 00:15:01,434
And there's only one big toilet, and they
make you all go at the same time.

222
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:06,165
The kids at school were even worse.

223
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,117
You like the Monkees?

224
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:15,365
You know they don't write
their own songs.

225
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:18,117
- They do so.
- They don't play their own instruments.

226
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,197
No! No!

227
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:22,882
That's not even
Michael Nesmith's real hat.

228
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:27,580
- Kids can be so cruel.
- But it's true.

229
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:30,634
They didn't write their own songs
or play their own instruments.

230
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,815
The Monkees
weren't about music, Marge.

231
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,473
They were about rebellion,
about political and social upheaval.

232
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:41,242
- Did you talk about me in therapy today?
- I don't think so.

233
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:43,054
Tell me the truth!

234
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:45,973
Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't.

235
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,222
Happy family. Happy family.

236
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,577
I keep having the same dream.

237
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:54,614
I'm the mother from Lost in Space.

238
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,550
Ready for breakfast, Dr. Smith?

239
00:15:57,718 --> 00:16:00,134
Oh, being stuck
on this godforsaken planet...

240
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,903
...has vanquished
what little appetite I had.

241
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:10,846
Warning! Warning!
Dr. Smith refuses to do his astro-chores.

242
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:13,363
Why, you clattering clank of cogs and...

243
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:16,618
My dear lady, as you well know,
my back is a disaster area.

244
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,833
D'oh, the pain! D'oh, the pain of it all!

245
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:23,598
Danger! Danger!
My hooks are flailing wildly.

246
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:31,014
Wait! Daddy, wait! Please don't leave!

247
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:33,229
Take me with you!

248
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:38,598
Marge, are you aware you just said
"Please don't leave" to your daddy?

249
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,242
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

250
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,343
And you also infringed
on any number of copyrights.

251
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:46,400
Now, let's talk about your father.

252
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,333
Sure, okay. I'll talk about Father.

253
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,533
Father Christmas. That's what
they call Santa Claus in England.

254
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:55,300
They drive on the wrong side
of the road there. Now, that's crazy.

255
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,033
People always say how small England is,
but you couldn't fit it all in here.

256
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,600
Not by a long shot.
You know what, I'm cured.

257
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,933
Marge, get back here
and tell me about your father.

258
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:09,833
- What did he do for a living?
- Okay.

259
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,333
Okay, but you're gonna make
a big deal out of this.

260
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:16,300
- He was a pilot.
- A pilot? This is a big deal.

261
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,233
You see?

262
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,933
Marge, this may not be
the best time to bring this up...

263
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,300
...but your last check bounced.
- Wait, I'm remembering something.

264
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,933
- Yes, Marge, there's still the matter of...
- I was a little girl...

265
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:36,533
Goodbye, Margie. Be a good girl, now.

266
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,300
- Why does Daddy have to leave?
- Because he's a pilot.

267
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:45,133
- He flies all over the world.
- I wanna see Daddy fly.

268
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,800
Margie! No, come back!

269
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,567
Daddy? Daddy, where are you? Dad...?

270
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,167
So who wants preflight cookie?

271
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,067
- Fig Newtons? Hydrox?
- Daddy?

272
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,867
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

273
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,400
My father was a stewardess.

274
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:14,534
Marge, there's nothing
to be ashamed of here.

275
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:19,568
Today male flight attendants,
or stewards, are common.

276
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,768
- They are?
- Yes.

277
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:26,068
Thanks to trailblazers like your father.
You might say he was a pioneer.

278
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:27,634
Yeah.

279
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:30,234
You might even say
he was an American hero.

280
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,901
Let's not go nuts.

281
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,934
The important thing
is that we've pinpointed...

282
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:39,701
...the precise moment when
you developed your fear of flying.

283
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:42,368
Wait, some other stuff
is coming back to me.

284
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:45,249
Open wide.

285
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:49,318
Here comes the airplane.

286
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,700
This is what a corn field
looks like, honey.

287
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,524
You think those things could also
have contributed to my fear of flying?

288
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,156
- Yes, yes. It's all a rich tapestry.
- Oh, thank you. You've changed my life.

289
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:17,640
We've really just begun
to scratch the surface.

290
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,457
There's still the serious problem
of your husband.

291
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,277
That's okay. You don't have
to make her into a superwoman.

292
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:26,868
- She can get on the plane, that's plenty.
- Thank you, doctor.

293
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:29,452
Whenever the wind whistles
through the leaves...

294
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:33,445
...I'll think, "Lowenstein. Lowenstein."

295
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:36,801
- My name is Zweig.
- Lowenstein...

296
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:48,955
Don't worry about a thing, honey.
I'm gonna help you through this.

297
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:53,619
Those are all normal noises.

298
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:57,646
Luggage compartment closing.
Cross-checking.

299
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:01,136
Just sit back and relax.

300
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:07,193
That's just the engine powering up.

301
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:11,170
That's just the engine struggling.

302
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,445
That's just the carp
swimming around your ankles.
