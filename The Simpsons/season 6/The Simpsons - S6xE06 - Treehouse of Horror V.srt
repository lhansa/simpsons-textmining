1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:03,238
Hello, once again.

2
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:08,610
As usual, I must warn you all that this
year's Halloween show is very scary...

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,781
...and those of you with young children
may want to send them off to bed and...

4
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:18,253
Oh, my. It seems the show is so scary,
Congress won't even let us show it.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,957
Instead they've suggested the 1947
classic Glenn Ford movie...

6
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:23,859
...Two Hundred Miles to Oregon.

7
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:21,687
Well, it was a long trip,
but we're almost there.

8
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:24,857
Homer, did you remember to lock
the front door of the house?

9
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,164
Well, it's been two long trips,
but we're finally almost there again.

10
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,734
When you locked the front door,
did you remember to lock the back door?

11
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:42,542
Oh, no! We left Grampa
back at the gas station!

12
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,945
What about Grampa?

13
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,417
- Hello!
- Hi!

14
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:53,119
- We're here!
- Oh, goody.

15
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,088
The sea monkeys I ordered
have arrived.

16
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:57,557
Look at them cavort and caper.

17
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:00,660
Sir, they're the new
winter caretakers for the lodge.

18
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:03,996
Yes, they work hard
and they play hard.

19
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:07,033
This house has quite a long
and colorful history.

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,869
It was built on an ancient
Indian burial ground...

21
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:13,639
...and was the setting of Satanic rituals,
witch burnings...

22
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:16,542
...and five John Denver
Christmas specials.

23
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:19,078
John Denver.

24
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:28,588
That's odd. Usually the blood
gets off at the second floor.

25
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:38,230
Hey, I found a shortcut
through your hedge maze.

26
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,665
Why, you little...

27
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,633
No, no. Go easy on the wee one.

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,070
His father's gonna go crazy
and chop them all into haggis.

29
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:46,438
What's haggis?

30
00:02:46,638 --> 00:02:49,975
Boy, you read my thoughts!
You've got the shinning.

31
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:52,978
- You mean shining.
- You want to get sued?

32
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:56,014
Now, look, boy,
if your da goes gaga...

33
00:02:56,181 --> 00:03:01,720
...you just use that shin of yours
to call me and I'll come a-running.

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,890
But don't be reading my mind
between 4 and 5.

35
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:06,325
That's Willie's time!

36
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:13,265
Yes, by cutting off cable TV
and the beer supply...

37
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:16,268
...I can ensure an honest winter's work
out of those lowlifes.

38
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:19,338
Sir, did you ever stop to think
that maybe it was doing this...

39
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:23,175
...that caused the previous caretakers
to go insane and murder their families?

40
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:26,411
Perhaps. Tell you what, we come back
and everyone's slaughtered...

41
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:27,913
...I owe you a Coke.

42
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,923
Cable's out. Think I'll have a beer.

43
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:41,426
Not a drop in the house.
What do you know.

44
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:44,296
Homer, I'm impressed.
You're taking this quite well.

45
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:46,831
I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!

46
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:49,968
- Homer!
- Sorry. Sorry. Don't worry.

47
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:52,537
There's plenty I can do
to keep myself occupied.

48
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,906
Maybe I'll check out
that ax collection.

49
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:56,774
See you later.

50
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,610
Mom, is Dad gonna kill us?

51
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,745
We're just gonna have to
wait and see.

52
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,118
- So, what'll it be, Homer?
- Moe, give me a beer!

53
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:09,120
No. Not unless you kill your family.

54
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:11,289
Why should I kill my family?

55
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,057
They'd be much happier as ghosts.

56
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:16,427
- You don't look so happy.
- Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy.

57
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,197
See? Now waste your family,
I'll give you a beer.

58
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:23,167
Homer? Homie?

59
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:26,371
What he's typed will be a window
into his madness.

60
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,610
"Feeling fine."

61
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,579
Wow, that's a relief.

62
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:48,192
This is less encouraging.

63
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:53,197
Well, what do you think, Marge?

64
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:55,533
All I need is a title.

65
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,735
I was thinking along the lines of...

66
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:03,340
...No TV and No Beer Make Homer
something, something.

67
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,875
Go Crazy?

68
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:07,310
Don't mind if I do!

69
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,721
Stay away from me, Homer!

70
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:20,257
Give me the bat, Marge!
Give me the bat!

71
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:22,559
Give me the bat! Come on.
Give me the bat.

72
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:24,428
Give me the bat...

73
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,597
Scaredy cat.

74
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:36,173
You stay here till
you're no longer insane.

75
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,275
Chili would be good tonight.

76
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:43,413
Homer, it's Moe.

77
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:46,149
Look, some of the ghouls and I
are a little concerned...

78
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:49,352
...the project isn't moving forward.
- Can't murder now. Eating.

79
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,023
- For crying out loud. Come on.
- No!

80
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:00,130
Here's Johnny!

81
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,768
David Letterman!

82
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:07,637
Hi, David. I'm Grampa.

83
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,941
I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer.
And I'm Ed Bradley.

84
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:14,677
All this and Andy Rooney
tonight on 60 Minutes!

85
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,650
Hello, police, this is Marge Simpson.

86
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,352
My husband is on
a murderous rampage. Over.

87
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:26,989
Well, thank God that's over.
I was worried there for a second.

88
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,858
- No answer.
- Don't worry, Mom.

89
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:32,828
I can use my shinning to call Willie.

90
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,833
And that was the first time
she'd ever flown a plane.

91
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:40,970
The little fat boy and his family
are in trouble.

92
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,873
I'm coming to rescue the lot of you!

93
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,477
All right, loony,
show me what you got.

94
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:51,314
Is that the best you can do?

95
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,417
Oh, my. I hope that rug
was Scotchgarded.

96
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:58,254
Must kill family.

97
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,237
- Had been given rifles,
but no ammunition.

98
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:16,939
- Fortunately, there was a hardware store.
- Dad, look!

99
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:20,176
Television! Teacher!
Mother! Secret lover.

100
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:22,945
Urge to kill fading.

101
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:25,581
Fading. Fading.

102
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:27,950
Rising! Fading.

103
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,953
Fading. Gone.

104
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:37,892
Come, family.
Sit in the snow with Daddy...

105
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:43,732
...and let us all bask in television's
warm, glowing, warming glow.

106
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:48,436
Live from Broadway,
it's The Tony Awards.

107
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:51,673
With your hosts,
Tyne Daly and Hal Linden.

108
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,110
- Homer, change channel.
- Can't. Frozen.

109
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,683
Urge to kill rising.

110
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:07,324
You know, Marge,
I've had my share of troubles.

111
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,526
But sitting here now
with you and the kids...

112
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:12,395
...in our cozy home in this beautiful,
free country...

113
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:16,366
...it just makes me feel
that I'm really a lucky guy.

114
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,402
Dad, your hand is jammed
in the toaster!

115
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,037
What?

116
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,677
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off of me!

117
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:33,250
Dad, it's in there again!

118
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,419
No! It's stuck on my hand.

119
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:43,860
This shouldn't be too hard to fix,
with the right tools.

120
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:51,368
There. Better than new.

121
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:56,472
Now, to take her for a test toast.

122
00:08:58,507 --> 00:08:59,842
What the...?

123
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,316
Look at that.

124
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:11,387
I'm the first non-Brazilian person
to travel backwards through time.

125
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,289
Correction, Homer. You're the second.

126
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,724
- That's right, Mr. Peabody.
- Quiet, you.

127
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,969
I've gone back to the time when
dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos.

128
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,238
Okay, don't panic.

129
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:32,508
Remember the advice your father
gave you on your wedding day.

130
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:36,378
If you ever travel back in time,
don't step on anything.

131
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:38,814
Because even the tiniest change...

132
00:09:38,981 --> 00:09:42,284
...can alter the future
in ways you can't imagine.

133
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:46,255
Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still
and don't touch anything...

134
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,124
...I won't destroy the future.

135
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:52,161
Stupid bug! You go squish now!

136
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,764
That was just one little
insignificant mosquito.

137
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:59,033
That can't change the future, right?

138
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:01,102
Right?

139
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:08,977
I'm back.

140
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:16,718
My loving family. Nothing's changed.

141
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,190
Hidilly-ho, slave-a-reenos.

142
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,058
Okilly-dokilly.

143
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:28,229
Hey, what the hell is that geek
Flanders doing on TV?

144
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:33,034
I see by the big board we got
a Negative Nelly in sector two.

145
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,937
I'm gonna have to ask
the whole family to kind of freeze...

146
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:37,805
...and prepare for re-Neducation.

147
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,340
Don't you remember, Dad?

148
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,176
Flanders is the unquestioned
lord and master of the world.

149
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:57,492
Okay, everybody.
Let's see some big smiles.

150
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:03,064
Just relax.
Let the hooks do their work.

151
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,667
What the hell are you smiling at?

152
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:09,404
Now, in case all that smiling
didn't cheer you up...

153
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,506
...there's one thing that never fails:

154
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:15,909
A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap,
and a total frontal lobotomy.

155
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,978
It's not so bad, Homer.

156
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,881
They go in through your nose...

157
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,984
...and they let you keep
the piece of brain they cut out.

158
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,353
Look. Hello.

159
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,290
Hello there. Who's that big man there?
Who's that?

160
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,027
- Join us, Father.
- Join us, Father.

161
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:36,397
It's bliss.

162
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:38,799
No!

163
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:47,518
I gotta go back, fix future.

164
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:53,591
This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.

165
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:59,797
Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it.

166
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:04,802
I wish, I wish
I hadn't killed that fish

167
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,844
Hey, where is everybody?

168
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,516
Hey, there's a bug that looks like Dad.

169
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,718
- Let's kill it.
- Okay.

170
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,005
This is gonna cost me.

171
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,579
I mean, hey.

172
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:53,215
Good morning, Father, dear.
Hope you're well.

173
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:56,385
Are we taking the Lexus to
Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today?

174
00:12:56,719 --> 00:13:00,923
Fabulous house, well-behaved kids,
sisters-in-law dead, luxury sedan...

175
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:03,025
I hit the jackpot!

176
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:06,862
Marge, dear, would you
kindly pass me a doughnut?

177
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:08,831
Doughnut? What's a doughnut?

178
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,771
It's raining again.

179
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:21,177
You're still not in
your own world, Homer.

180
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:25,214
I can get you home,
but you have to do exactly as I...

181
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:29,986
This is indeed a disturbing universe.

182
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:34,657
Don't touch anything?
I'll touch whatever I feel like!

183
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:49,572
Foolish earthling, totally unprepared
for the effects of time travel.

184
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:04,820
- What happened to us, Kodos?
- Quiet, you.

185
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:15,764
- Good morning.
- What's my name?

186
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,034
What color is the sky?
What of doughnuts? What?

187
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,336
For the love of God, tell me!

188
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:26,007
Homer, the sky is blue, doughnuts are
plentiful, Friday is TGIF night on ABC.

189
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:27,742
- What's gotten into you?
- Nothing.

190
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:30,412
Nothing at all. Let's just eat.

191
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,154
Close enough.

192
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,198
Hey, everybody!
Let's all turn our desks backwards...

193
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,200
...before Mrs. Krabappel shows up.

194
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:53,802
- Yeah!
- Great idea!

195
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:01,309
All right, backwards boy,
back your butt down to detention.

196
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:04,846
Over here, Simpson.

197
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:08,350
The detention room is overcrowded,
so you'll be serving in the cafeteria.

198
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:09,751
Oxygen running out.

199
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,954
You should've thought of that
before you made that paper airplane.

200
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,925
This overcrowding in detention
is becoming critical.

201
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:20,195
It's a powder keg waiting to go off
in an explosion of bad behavior.

202
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:21,997
Don't bitch to me, boss man.

203
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:25,166
Thanks to the latest budget cuts,
I'm down to using Grade F meat.

204
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,505
It would be wonderful if there was a
common solution to both our problems.

205
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:33,642
- That would be great.
- Hey, Bart. Watch this.

206
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:37,912
Oh, no! My favorite outfit!

207
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,283
Jimbo, this is by far the worst...

208
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:48,523
Jimbo, why don't you assist
Lunchlady Doris in the kitchen?

209
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,192
- Bite me, Skinner.
- Well, might we.

210
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,561
It's hard for me
to clean this giant pot...

211
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:57,032
...when you keep spilling
meat tenderizer all over me.

212
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,735
Oh, great!
Now I gotta work in the dark.

213
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,476
This sandwich tastes
so young and impudent.

214
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:11,012
Seymour, what's with the good grub?

215
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,782
Well, perhaps I ought to
let you folks in on a secret.

216
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:17,485
You remember me telling Jimbo Jones
that I'd make something of him one day?

217
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,522
Are you saying you killed Jimbo...

218
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,658
...processed his carcass,
and served him for lunch?

219
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,900
I wonder where Jimbo is today.

220
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,769
He should've beaten us up
for our lunch money an hour ago.

221
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:38,239
Frau Lunchlady, please to have
another Sloppy Jimbo?

222
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,378
That's your third helping, young man.
It's making you fat and soft...

223
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:45,780
...and tender.

224
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,750
You just cut in line, didn't you?

225
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,353
- Report to detention, Uter.
- For how long?

226
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,922
About seven minutes a pound
should do it.

227
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,629
Okay, I got your German grub right here.

228
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:05,233
Bart, does it strike you as odd
that Uter disappeared...

229
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,770
...and suddenly they're serving us this
mysterious food called "Uterbraten"?

230
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,271
Oh, relax, kids.

231
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,742
I've got a gut feeling
Uter's around here somewhere.

232
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:18,213
After all, isn't there
a little Uter in all of us?

233
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:24,586
In fact, you might even say
we just ate Uter...

234
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:28,056
...and he's in our stomachs
right now!

235
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:31,793
Wait, scratch that one.

236
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:33,695
Mom! Mom! You've gotta help!

237
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,231
They're cooking kids
in the school cafeteria!

238
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,667
Listen, kids,
you're 8 and 10 years old now.

239
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,536
- I can't fight all your battles for you.
- But, Mom!

240
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:44,406
No buts. You march
right back to that school...

241
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:47,575
...look them straight in the eye
and say, "Don't eat me."

242
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:49,244
- Okay.
- Okay.

243
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,185
Since so many students have been
put on permanent detention...

244
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,488
...we've merged everyone
into a single class.

245
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:03,491
I trust there are no objections?

246
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:11,499
Detention.

247
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,349
Hey, you guys, I was just thinking
that any one of us could be next.

248
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:30,285
So, what do you say
we make a break for it?

249
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:45,899
Easy there, young man. You'll only
make yourself tired and stringy.

250
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:48,602
Now to check on
the free-range children.

251
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:55,375
Hold on, kids!

252
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,745
I'm coming to rescue
the lot of you! I'll...

253
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:01,381
I'm bad at this.

254
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:08,989
I'm going to enjoy devouring you,
Bart Simpson.

255
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:13,493
Yes, I believe I'll start
as you've so often suggested...

256
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,229
...by eating your shorts.

257
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:32,479
Don't worry, guys. Something
always comes along to save us.

258
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,449
Nevertheless, I remain confident...

259
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:39,753
...that something will come along
and save the two Simpson children.

260
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,129
Relax, honey. You were just
having a crazy nightmare.

261
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:52,766
You're back with your family now,
where there's nothing to be afraid of...

262
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,635
...except that fog
that turns people inside out.

263
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:59,272
It's seeping in.

264
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,440
Stupid, cheap weather stripping!

265
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:15,221
One chorus line of people

266
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:18,691
Dancing till they make us stop

267
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:20,526
Two!

268
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:25,631
Many dancing people
Covered with blood, gore and glop

269
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:32,205
Just one sniff of that fog
And you're inside out

270
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:39,378
It's worse than that flesh-eating virus
You've read about

271
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:43,349
Vital organs
They are what we're dressed in

272
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:47,320
The family dog is eyeing Bart's intestine

273
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,526
Happy Halloween
