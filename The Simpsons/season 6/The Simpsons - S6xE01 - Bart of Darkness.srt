1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,938
Bart of Darkness

2
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,575
Well, you're certainly doing your
job today, Mr. Sun.

3
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:40,079
Oh, rats.

4
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:44,417
And here we have
the world-famous Beatles...

5
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:47,954
...exactly as they looked performing
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

6
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:51,558
I hardly think it's fair to be
charged full price.

7
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:54,595
I'm up to my knees
in the original cast of M* A * S *H.

8
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:09,579
- Homer, my hat goes off to you.
- It's cool in here, boy.

9
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:13,383
For the rest of the summer,
we can live inside the refrigerator.

10
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:17,288
Homer, the fridge wasn't meant
to be used this way.

11
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:21,359
Although I must say,
it's certainly refreshing.

12
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,369
I got the idea when I noticed
the refrigerator was cold.

13
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:32,638
Won't this overload the motor?

14
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:40,080
Marge, can you set the oven to cold?

15
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:55,064
Ice cream! Ice cream!

16
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:03,073
I'm all out of ice cream! It's true,
you know. Ice cream! Ice cream!

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,812
Fresh out of ice cream!

18
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:09,698
Face it, Bart. Our salvation isn't gonna
roll by on the back of some stupid truck.

19
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:16,406
I gotta replace that window.

20
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,174
- Pool-mobile?
- Pool-mobile?

21
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:27,986
Look, Lis, I snatched five
bathing suits. All Martin's.

22
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:31,189
Take your best shot.
I'm wearing 17 layers.

23
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,463
I brought this on myself.

24
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:42,135
Okay, little dudes, time's up.
Everybody out!

25
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:47,341
- Time's up?
- So long, Lis.

26
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:50,177
I'm gonna stow away underwater
and go where the pool goes.

27
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,813
Have a good life.

28
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,755
Sorry, Bart, dude. We gotta fill
this thing with Epsom salts...

29
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:03,826
...and jam over to the old folks' home.
- Oh, well. Same time tomorrow, Otto?

30
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:07,897
No way, man. One day of summer's
all we're budgeted for.

31
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,701
I guess it is kind of a tease.

32
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:15,339
Dad?

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,575
Dad?

34
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,879
- Dad!
- Yes, Lisa?

35
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,981
Dad, as you know,
we've been swimming.

36
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:24,783
And we've developed a taste for it.

37
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:27,887
We both agree that getting
our own pool is the only way to go.

38
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,757
Now, before you respond,
understand that your refusal...

39
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:32,826
...would result in
months and months of:

40
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:35,562
- Can we have a pool, Dad?
- Can we have a pool, Dad?

41
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:38,065
- Can we have a pool, Dad?
- Can we have a pool, Dad?

42
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:39,900
I understand.

43
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:44,939
Let us celebrate our new arrangement
with the adding of chocolate to milk.

44
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:52,181
Over here we have the Hick Tub,
the Insta-Rust.

45
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:53,816
That's the Lightning Magnet.

46
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,219
- That's the Tinkler.
- The Tinkler.

47
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:58,455
I like the sound of that.
We'll take it.

48
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,025
Is it true we should wait at least
an hour after eating before we go in?

49
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:05,930
Look, question lady, this job is not
what I really do, okay? I play keyboards.

50
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:23,617
All right, everybody in the pool!

51
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,987
'Tis a fine barn,
but sure 'tis no pool, English.

52
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:31,225
- Is it a pool yet?
- Yes, Dad.

53
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:34,128
Who could that be?

54
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,901
Hello, Mrs. Bart.

55
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:40,869
Is your pool ready yet?

56
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:50,280
Bart, are all these children
friends of yours?

57
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:52,516
Friends and well-wishers, yes.

58
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:53,984
- Hey, Bart.
- Hi, Bart.

59
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:56,821
- Hey, my buddy, Bart.
- Hello, Mrs. Converdale.

60
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,698
People! People, it's time we all
discussed the pool-safety rules.

61
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,333
Jump, Bart, jump!

62
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,602
Jump, Bart, jump!

63
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:11,137
You got it.

64
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:14,775
Hey, Bart! Your epidermis is showing!

65
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,210
It is?

66
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:23,518
See, epidermis means your hair.

67
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:28,790
So technically it's true.
That's what makes it so funny.

68
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:30,859
Pardon me a moment.

69
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:36,633
Hey, Nelson. He's really hurt.
I think he broke his leg.

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,934
I said:

71
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:41,492
I'm sorry, that leg's gonna
have to come off.

72
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:46,999
Did I say leg?
I meant that wet bathing suit.

73
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,202
I'm afraid you'll need a cast
on that broken bone.

74
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:53,039
I'm gonna miss the whole summer.

75
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:57,611
Don't worry, boy. When you get a job
like me, you'll miss every summer.

76
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:00,280
Isn't it amazing, the same
day you got a pool...

77
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,516
...is the same day we realized
we liked you?

78
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:04,852
The timing worked out great,
don't you think?

79
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,256
- Hi.
- Hey, guys! Sign my cast?

80
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,926
Sign my cast? Guys?

81
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,332
- Milhouse!
- Hi, Bart.

82
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:21,838
Faithful Milhouse. You'll spend the long,
hot days by my side, won't you?

83
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,976
I think I lost my glasses in your pool.
I better go in and find them.

84
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:29,413
- But you're wearing your glasses.
- No, I'm not.

85
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:32,951
Oh, look. Bart's all alone.

86
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:35,253
Maybe I should keep him company,
at least for a little while.

87
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:39,124
- Hey, come watch this.
- Lisa! Hey, look.

88
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,300
Coming!

89
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:52,573
Well, it looks like it's just
you and me, Barty boy.

90
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,244
Great. I get to spend
the summer with my brain.

91
00:06:56,644 --> 00:07:00,148
What fun can you have in a pool anyway
that you can't have in a bathtub...

92
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:02,684
...with a garbage bag taped
around your cast?

93
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:47,769
Traitors! Go on and have your pool!
I'm fine by myself right here.

94
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:44,600
You know, this isn't so bad.

95
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,370
I'll just spend the summer
getting better acquainted...

96
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:50,240
...with an old friend called television.

97
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:57,681
Hope you enjoyed that, kids, because
Krusty's out of here for the summer.

98
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:00,251
In the meantime, we'll be running...

99
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:04,689
...classic Krusty. Enjoy!

100
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:13,399
Good evening. Tonight my guest
is AFL-CIO Chairman George Meany...

101
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,336
...who will be discussing
collective-bargaining agreements.

102
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:19,172
- It's a pleasure to be here, Krusty.
- Let me be blunt.

103
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:22,076
Is there a labor crisis
in America today?

104
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:24,312
Well, that depends
what you mean by crisis.

105
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,551
There's nothing like
rising with the sun...

106
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:33,555
...for a quiet, peaceful dip
in your very own pool.

107
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,469
Lisa, the blob has got me!
Don't touch me or it'll get you too!

108
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:49,874
Dad, you have to put chlorine in
the water every day to keep it clean.

109
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,843
Chlorine, eh?

110
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,216
My face is on fire!

111
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:01,754
Oh, look. There's Bart. Wave to him.

112
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:06,893
Maybe we should spend
more time with Bart.

113
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:09,696
He's becoming isolated and weird.

114
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:14,402
"I swear I don't know where the
bombs are! Only the miners know that!"

115
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:18,607
"Maybe this will loosen your tongue."
"No!"

116
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:21,610
- Bart?
- Don't turn on that light!

117
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,013
Sorry, I just came to see
how you were feeling.

118
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,883
- I'm fine, just fine.
- What are you writing here, a play?

119
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:30,153
- No.
- "Cast of characters:

120
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,156
Viceroy Fizzlebottom,
a hearty cherub of a man..."

121
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:35,492
Give me that! It's a work in progress.

122
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:38,362
So.

123
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:40,298
How do you like
being Miss Popularity?

124
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:43,268
Oh, well, you know, it ain't so great.

125
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:47,840
Bart, it's the best thing that ever
happened to me in my whole life!

126
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:51,377
Well, anyway, I brought you a present.
Look, it's the telescope I won...

127
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:52,812
...at the Optics Festival.

128
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:56,349
There was an Optics Festival
and I wasn't informed? You go now.

129
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,085
- But...
- Go!

130
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:05,226
What have we here?
"The Lighter Side of Hippies."

131
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,830
They don't care whose toes
they step on.

132
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:19,442
This was a lovely idea, Homie.

133
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,811
Come here and kiss me.

134
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:30,555
Do not be alarmed.
Continue swimming naked.

135
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:36,829
Come on. Continue. Come on...

136
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,998
All right, Lou, open fire.

137
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,240
Wow, the universe is so boring.

138
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:52,279
I know. I'll use this to peer into
Springfield's seamy underbelly.

139
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:01,824
It turned out it was his evil twin.

140
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:10,633
Grace, come here. There's a
sinister-looking kid I want you to see.

141
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:15,873
I'm never gonna see anything interesting
with this stupid piece of junk.

142
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:23,782
That came from Flanders' house.

143
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:36,363
Oh, my God! What have I done?
I've killed her!

144
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:41,168
It can't be what it looks like.
This is Flanders we're talking about.

145
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,471
I'll just watch some TV.

146
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:48,076
Now, what you've been waiting for:
Another long raga by Ravi Shankar.

147
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,396
- Shankar.
- Shankar.

148
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,431
Groovy, man.

149
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:06,481
This can't be what it looks like.
There's gotta be some other explanation.

150
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:10,519
I wish there was some other
explanation for this, but there isn't!

151
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:12,821
I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!

152
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:15,224
Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.

153
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,394
I'm a mur-diddly-erdiler!

154
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:21,398
If that's not Flanders,
he's done his homework.

155
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:28,272
Daddy, where's Mommy?
We miss her.

156
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,309
Mommy had to go away.
She's with God now.

157
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:34,112
Can we go there too?

158
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,114
Soon enough.

159
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,119
He's gonna kill Rod and Todd too!

160
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,921
That's horrible...

161
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,589
...in principle.

162
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:48,228
Look, Lisa. I found this change
on the bottom of the pool.

163
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,064
- You can have it.
- Thanks, Nelson.

164
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,969
Somebody took my juice money.

165
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,406
Lisa, please join my family
for a weekend in the country.

166
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:00,308
There'll be hunting, charades...

167
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:03,479
...and ever so many delightful,
romantic misunderstandings.

168
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:05,714
- Lisa, Lisa!
- Watch me!

169
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:08,751
They're only using you
for your pool, you know.

170
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:12,188
Shut up, brain. I got friends now.
I don't need you anymore.

171
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,428
Yeah, I'd love to go to your house.

172
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,166
My plan has come to fruition.

173
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,369
Soon I'll be queen of summertime.

174
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,037
Oh, king. King!

175
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:37,317
Dude, buzz has it an even wussier kid
has an even better pool than this.

176
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:46,286
Hello? Hey, I'm stuck in here.

177
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,522
I gotta think of a way to get out.

178
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,493
Well, well, well.
Look who 's come crawling back.

179
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,562
Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife!

180
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,998
But why? She's such a fox.

181
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,468
I mean, what's on Fox tonight?
Something ribald, no doubt.

182
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,271
I wish you'd stop spreading
bad rumors about people.

183
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:06,673
Remember how you got Grampa
tarred and feathered?

184
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,242
Sure. That was 20 minutes ago.

185
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,877
Gonna be in the tub for a while.

186
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,548
Bart, I'm really sorry
I've been ignoring you lately.

187
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,884
I got carried away with being popular.

188
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,787
But now that I'm unpopular again,
I want you to know I'm here for you.

189
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,090
You can start making it up
to me right now.

190
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,160
Flanders is leaving the house.
I want you to sneak in there...

191
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,695
...and bring me some evidence!
And something sweet.

192
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,398
Bart, I'm not gonna
break into somebody's house.

193
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,168
All right. You're right.
Let's just forget about that.

194
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,137
Here, let me read to you
from my play.

195
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:41,909
"Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga?
Is it Saint Swiven's Day already?

196
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:46,513
- 'Tis, replied Aunt Helga..."
- I'm going, I'm going.

197
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,561
A human head!

198
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,632
Of course.

199
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,203
Oh, no.
He's back. Flanders is back.

200
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,838
Lisa, get out of there!

201
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,808
No, Lisa, don't go upstairs.
You'll be trapped!

202
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,445
An ax! He's got an ax!

203
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,681
I'll save you, Lisa!

204
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,184
I'll save you by calling the police.

205
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:29,189
Hello, and welcome to the Springfield
Police Department Rescue Phone.

206
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,893
If you know the name of the felony
being committed, press one.

207
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,029
To choose from a list of felonies,
press two.

208
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,299
If you are being murdered
or calling from a rotary phone...

209
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,135
...please stay on the line.

210
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,072
You have selected regicide.

211
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:49,610
If you know the name of the king
or queen being murdered, press one.

212
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,418
I'll save you, cast or no cast!

213
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:06,026
Gotta save Lisa,
trash can or no trash can.

214
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:23,243
Oh, no. That sinister-looking kid
is coming to kill me.

215
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,512
Help! Help!

216
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,523
Oh, no. Oh, no.

217
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,293
It's time to put you away.

218
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,563
Put you away for good.

219
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,968
No!

220
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,905
What the gumdrops is going on here?

221
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,575
I came to stop you from murdering Lisa
like you murdered your wife!

222
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,544
Murdered?

223
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,583
Murdered? No, I've just been
in the country for a week.

224
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,486
But I distinctly heard you say
that Maude was with God.

225
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:44,224
That's right. I was at Bible camp. I was
learning how to be more judgmental.

226
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,961
But I saw the murder, and then I saw
you bury the corpse in the backyard!

227
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,898
All right, it's true! I am a murderer!

228
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,201
I over-watered Maude's
favorite ficus plant...

229
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,004
...I panicked, and then
I buried the remains.

230
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,806
I was hoping to replace it
before you got home.

231
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,142
But I heard a woman scream.

232
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,780
- Well, now, that I can't explain.
- We found it, chief.

233
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,017
Well, I guess that explains everything.

234
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:15,022
Not everything. There's still the little
matter of the whereabouts of your wife.

235
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,558
- I'm right here.
- Oh, I see.

236
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,928
Then everything is wrapped up
in a neat little package.

237
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,297
Really, I mean that.

238
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,566
Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.

239
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,405
More friends! More allies!

240
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:34,274
More, I say.
Hang those who talk of less.

241
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,610
There's a few inches over here.

242
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,087
My precious pool
and its lifestyle accouterments.

243
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,655
No!

244
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,291
- What a drag.
- I hear you.

245
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,503
The gentle caress of a summer breeze.
