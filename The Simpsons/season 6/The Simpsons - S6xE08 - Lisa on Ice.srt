00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lisa on Ice

2
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:29,838
It's Channel 6 Action News.

3
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:33,300
Ah, Action News.

4
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,303
The last place an impressionable kid
can go for TV violence.

5
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,431
Now here's your Action anchor,
Kent Brockman.

6
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,850
Hello, I'm Kent Brockman!
Our top stories tonight:

7
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:44,186
A tremendous explosion
in the price of lumber.

8
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:46,563
"President Reagan dyes...

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,691
...his hair, " says Gary Trudeau
in his new musical comedy review.

10
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:52,986
But first let's check the death count
from the killer storm...

11
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,781
...bearing down on us
like a shotgun full of snow.

12
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:00,869
As of now, the death count is zero.
But it is ready to shoot right up.

13
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,539
Oh, my God!
Damn you, snow!

14
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:07,584
All right! Snow day!
No school tomorrow!

15
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:12,172
That doesn't mean no book report.
What if the weatherman is wrong?

16
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,650
Lisa, that man is a
professional meteorologist.

17
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:18,695
Kent, I'd like to remind everybody
to come down and watch me...

18
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:22,073
...at the Springfield Laugh and Brew
and Burgers and Fries on Saturday.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,910
The forecast calls for
a 75%/% chance of hilarity.

20
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,453
I like those odds.

21
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,873
Snowball fight!

22
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:41,634
You're gonna eat a blizzard of...

23
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:43,720
...unseasonable warmth?

24
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:46,889
I made the snowball from the frost
in our freezer.

25
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,977
Nice P.J. S, Simpson.

26
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:54,229
Did your mommy buy them for you?

27
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,398
Of course she did.
Who else would have?

28
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:02,529
All right, Simpson.
You win this round.

29
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,907
Okay, it's book report time.

30
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:08,660
We'll do them alphabetically.
Today it's A through M.

31
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:11,997
I'm saved!
I love being a Simpson.

32
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:13,749
Let's see. We have no A's.

33
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:15,918
So let's go right to the B's.
Bart.

34
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,629
Mrs. Krabappel...

35
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,964
...I didn't...

36
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,008
Attention. This is Principal Skinner...

37
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:26,136
...your principal, with a message
from the principal's office.

38
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:28,805
All students proceed immediately
to an assembly...

39
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,641
...in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium.

40
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,352
Damn it, I wish we hadn't let
the students name that.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,147
Children, the times they are
becoming quite different.

42
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:39,775
Test scores are at an all-time low.

43
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,819
So I've come up with these
academic alerts!

44
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:47,698
You will receive one as soon as
your grades start to slip in any subject.

45
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,826
Your parents won't have to wait
until report cards to punish you.

46
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:52,828
How innovative. I like it.

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,707
Hey, Dolph, take a memo
on your Newton: Beat up Martin.

48
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:02,213
Bah!

49
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:05,508
All right, first academic alert:
Wiggum, Ralph.

50
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:08,052
I won! I won!

51
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:12,598
No. No, Ralph.
This means you're failing English.

52
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,851
Me fail English?
That's "unpossible."

53
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,022
Muntz, Nelson. You're failing
history, geography and math.

54
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:24,235
- But you're doing quite well in home ec.
- Hey! Keep it down, man.

55
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:25,903
Simpson...

56
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,655
...Lisa.

57
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:31,200
Grades are all I have.
What could I be failing?

58
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,494
I'm smart and a teacher's pet.

59
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:40,251
Gym?! That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard!

60
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:52,012
Lisa, your father and I are very
concerned about this warning.

61
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,180
I really hope you try harder.

62
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:58,435
That's all of them. And I'm so proud
you didn't try to forge my name.

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,936
How about a present, son?

64
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:02,188
Well, I could use a new pair
of hockey skates.

65
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:04,399
- Done and done.
- That's not fair.

66
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:07,277
Why is Bart getting a present,
and I'm getting chewed out?

67
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:09,654
Ah, the mysteries of life.

68
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:11,072
Tell you what, Simpson.

69
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:15,118
I won't fail you if you join one of
those Pee Wee teams outside the school.

70
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:18,121
You mean, where parents push kids
into vicious competition...

71
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:20,707
...to compensate for
their own failed dreams of glory?

72
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,417
Look, I don't need this.

73
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:25,503
I inhaled my favorite whistle
this morning.

74
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:44,606
Children, that was our only ball.
There'll be no team this year.

75
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:54,489
Mom, this is really scary.
I'm gonna get my first F ever.

76
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:58,285
Cheer up. So you're not good at sports.
It's a very small part of life.

77
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:01,037
Sports, sports, sports, sports

78
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:05,500
Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat
today because he's a good guy at sports.

79
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,253
I think Lisa needs to feel
a little special tonight.

80
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,298
How about letting her
ride up front too?

81
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,091
I tried.

82
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:18,430
Okay, son. Just remember
to have fun out there today.

83
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:23,643
- And if you lose, I'll kill you!
- Oh, Dad.

84
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:32,152
All right, Pigs, beat those Gougers.

85
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:40,744
I could've been equipment manager,
but no!

86
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,757
Our goalie cannot stand up.

87
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:55,217
Tell you what, get some rope.

88
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:12,609
Defense! Defense!
Come on! You call that blowing!

89
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:19,366
Oh, yes, we won!
We won! We won!

90
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,202
Unfortunately, since I bet
on the other team...

91
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,162
...we won't be going for pizza.

92
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:30,543
Well, boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up
to my side of the agreement.

93
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,295
Here's your turtle, alive and well.

94
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,090
Aw, thanks, Dad.

95
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:38,884
How about some adulation
from my little sister?

96
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,513
Wow, Bart, I'm so impressed you were
able to give Milhouse a concussion.

97
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:44,306
Aw, you're just jealous.

98
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:48,727
Because... you... stink... at... sports!

99
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:50,646
- Cut it out, Bart!
- What the...?

100
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:57,278
You know, I wonder if her skills
will transfer over to the game of hockey.

101
00:06:57,445 --> 00:07:01,532
Well, only one way to be sure.
Heads up, little girl!

102
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:06,537
The goalie of my dreams!

103
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:11,417
Let's try a hard one to make sure
it wasn't a fluke.

104
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:17,465
Hey! Way to knock out my teeth!

105
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,009
Yeah, that's it, Milhouse.
Keep up the chatter.

106
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:27,709
Lisa, if the Bible has taught us
nothing else, and it hasn't...

107
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:30,253
...it's that girls should stick
to girl sports.

108
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,424
Such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing
and such and such.

109
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:37,177
I think women should be able to play
any sport men play.

110
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:41,223
But hockey is so violent and dangerous.
Look at Milhouse's teeth.

111
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,100
Mom, will you stop showing us those?

112
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:45,268
I have to join the team
or I'll get an F...

113
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:48,021
...that will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

114
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:52,192
I now pronounce you
president of these United...

115
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:55,570
Stop the inauguration! I just discovered
our president-elect...

116
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,531
...got an F in second-grade gym class!

117
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:03,745
In that case, I sentence you to a lifetime
of horror on Monster Island.

118
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,580
Don't worry. It's just a name.

119
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,004
He said it was just a name!

120
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,415
What he meant is that Monster Island
is actually a peninsula.

121
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,338
Do you have my teeth?

122
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,174
No.

123
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:31,305
Okay, hotshots. Now that my daughter
is on your team...

124
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:33,516
...I want to make a few things clear.

125
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,601
Please, Dad. I'll be fine.

126
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:41,106
I don't want anyone to give her
a hard time just because she's different.

127
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:43,400
No jokes, no taunting...

128
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:47,071
Look! That kid's got bosoms!
Who's got a wet towel?

129
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:50,324
Come here, you butterball.

130
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:53,619
Don't make me run!
I'm full of chocolate!

131
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:04,171
I can't watch. I don't know how
you two can sit here...

132
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:07,132
...laughing at poor Lisa
while she's probably scared to death.

133
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:12,263
We're laughing with her, Marge.
There's a big difference.

134
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,468
With her.

135
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,679
You really think I did okay
out there, Mom?

136
00:09:21,887 --> 00:09:26,225
Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net,
I really think you helped your team.

137
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,011
Okay, little buddy. Hop in.

138
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,723
I mean my little girl buddy.

139
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:36,978
That's very nice, but it's wrong for you
to reward violent, competitive behavior.

140
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:40,565
However, I will sit up front with you
if it's a fatherly gesture of love.

141
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:42,233
Okay, hon.

142
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,653
Sucker! Competitive violence,
that's why you're here!

143
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:08,259
We're having our best season ever.

144
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:12,138
And I would like to say that
it is because of teamwork.

145
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,974
Gee, who am I kidding, huh?
It's all because of Lisa.

146
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,268
Let's hear it for Lisa!

147
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:22,607
Hey, Bart. If Lisa's better than you
at hockey...

148
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:26,360
...does that mean you're gonna become
better than her at school?

149
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:32,366
Maybe I will, Milhouse.
Maybe I will.

150
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:39,539
Who can tell me the capital of Spain?
Bart Simpson.

151
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,834
The square root of 36?
Bart Simpson.

152
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,253
Who freed the slaves?
Bart Simpson.

153
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:47,756
Bart Simpson. Bart Simpson.

154
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:51,635
Bart Simpson, stop raising your hand.
You haven't had one right answer today.

155
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:53,386
Sorry.

156
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:56,765
This is for wasting
teacher's valuable time!

157
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:02,270
Lay off, guys! He's with me.

158
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,316
It's a lucky coincidence
you happen to be your sister's brother.

159
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:09,361
Don't worry, Bart.
They won't bother you anymore.

160
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,575
I hardly ever let Mother
fight for me anymore.

161
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:18,703
Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna hang out
with Lisa...

162
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,247
...for protection...

163
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,624
...and to be seen!

164
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,994
Come watch TV with me, Dad.

165
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:30,706
We missed the first two Cops, but if
we hurry, we can catch the last three.

166
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:33,793
Oh, sorry, Bart. Lisa and I are going out
for gelato.

167
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,212
We'd ask you to come, but...

168
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,630
...you know.

169
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:42,677
- Bart, I can spend some time with you.
- I don't know, Mom.

170
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:45,930
Don't have a stereotypical view of me
just because I'm your mother.

171
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:49,350
I know. How about we play
the basketball?

172
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm no Harvey Globetrotter, but...

173
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:56,463
Hey, Milhouse! Knock him down
if he's in your way!

174
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,132
Jimbo, Jimbo! Go for the face!

175
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,051
Look! Ralph Wiggum lost
his shinguard!

176
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,971
Hack the bone!
Hack the bone!

177
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,433
Wow! Eye of the tiger!
Mouth of a teamster!

178
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:11,729
To think of all the time
I wasted on you!

179
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:15,190
Well, not wasted...

180
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:17,192
I love you.

181
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,864
Let me give my special little winner
a big, big hug.

182
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:25,576
Ma. I think I'm all hugged out.

183
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,912
Ah, one more.

184
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,334
Hello, Queen Lisa.

185
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,969
Bart! What are you doing in my room?

186
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:40,432
Lisa, certain differences, rivalries
if you will, have come up between us.

187
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:43,810
At first, I thought we could talk it over
like civilized people.

188
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:48,982
But instead, I just ripped the head
off Mr. Honey Bunny!

189
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,401
Bart, that was your cherished
childhood toy.

190
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,529
Mr. Honey Bunny!

191
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:59,451
- Quiet down, Bart!
- Bart, just get out of here.

192
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,370
- It's a free country. You get out.
- That doesn't make sense.

193
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,080
I know you are, but what am I?

194
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,540
Get out! Get out!

195
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:10,545
Okay! But on my way,
I'm gonna be doing this:

196
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:15,008
If you get hit, it's your own fault.

197
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:18,803
Okay. Then I'm gonna start
kicking air like this:

198
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,351
And if any part of you should fill that air,
it's your own fault.

199
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:36,503
I better go check that out.

200
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:40,466
Now, Homer, don't you eat this pie.

201
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:42,426
Okay.

202
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:44,928
All right, pie,
I'm just gonna do this:

203
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,974
And if you get eaten,
it's your own fault.

204
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,272
Oh, my...

205
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:57,441
Oh, the hell with it.

206
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:04,948
Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Stop it!

207
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:06,450
Mom, that is really annoying.

208
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:08,577
- Bart started it.
- Lisa started it.

209
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:11,288
I don't care who started it!
I don't want to see you...

210
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,998
...fighting like that ever again.

211
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:17,084
We love you both. You're not
in competition with each other.

212
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:20,797
Repeat, you are not in competition
with each other.

213
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:25,426
Hey! Apu just called. This Friday,
Lisa's team is playing Bart's team.

214
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,261
You're in direct competition!

215
00:14:27,428 --> 00:14:30,223
Don't go easy on each other
because you're brother and sister.

216
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:33,726
I want to see you both fighting
for your parents' love!

217
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:38,356
Fight! Fight! Fight!

218
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,113
Okay, I'm gonna make
a little deal with you mugs.

219
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:45,740
I'm gonna let you out to see my team
play the game...

220
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,867
...if you promise to return
to your cells.

221
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:51,371
Sorry, pig.
We can't make that promise.

222
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,832
All right. All right,
I'll sweeten the deal.

223
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:56,376
You can see the game,
you don't have to come back...

224
00:14:56,543 --> 00:15:00,421
...but you have to promise
not to commit any more crimes, okay?

225
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,508
- No.
- I'll take that as a yes.

226
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,844
All right, we're free!

227
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,910
You'll have to do better
than that tonight, chump.

228
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:19,915
I asked for ketchup!
I'm eating salad here.

229
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:23,127
I won't have any aggressive
condiment-passing in this house.

230
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:25,796
- Hello.
- Moe, what are you doing here?

231
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:29,717
What? What? A bartender can't come by
and say hi to his best customer?

232
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:33,303
Hey, hey there, Midge. Oh, gee,
I like what you done to your hair.

233
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,305
You caught me
at a real bad time, Moe.

234
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:38,100
I hope you understand I'm too tense
to pretend I like you.

235
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:41,687
Yeah, and how are the little kids doing?
I mean, really, how are they doing?

236
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,898
Any disabling injuries? Something
that the gambling community...

237
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:47,651
...might not yet know about?
Here, let me see those knees.

238
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:49,236
Moe, I think you should leave.

239
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:52,906
But Blanche, you gotta help me out here!
Please! I'm 64 grand in the hole!

240
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:55,075
They're gonna take my thumbs!

241
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:59,705
Charge!

242
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:04,851
Good luck tonight, sis.
I'll try not to hurt you!

243
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:08,855
Don't worry. I'm wearing
my lucky rabbit's head.

244
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,357
Mr. Honey Bunny!
You inhumane monster!

245
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,651
You want a piece of me?

246
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:15,570
Hey, hey. Stop it, stop it!

247
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,738
Conserve your precious hatred
for the game.

248
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:20,116
Now that we're all alone, Marge,
admit it.

249
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:21,951
- You like Lisa best.
- No!

250
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,328
- Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?
- No.

251
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:27,331
You can't possible like Maggie best.
What has she ever done?

252
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:29,292
Nothing for nobody.

253
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,752
Homer, we can't root for one child
over the other.

254
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,547
You wouldn't like it if the kids
played favorites with us.

255
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:39,093
- Hey, Mom! Look at me, Mom!
- Hi, Mom, over here! Mom!

256
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,012
Hi, kids.

257
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,391
And now to honor America,
here's Krusty the Clown.

258
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:03,534
Shouldn't have turned down
those cue cards.

259
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:17,797
I love Bart!

260
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:24,929
No, wait! I love Lisa!

261
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:27,724
Beer? Oh, Marge, I love you.

262
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,042
He tripped my boy!

263
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,378
I demand vengeance!
I want vengeance!

264
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,590
Jimbo Jones called for tripping.

265
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,593
A penalty shot will be taken
by Bart Simpson.

266
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,306
Oh, my God. A penalty shot
with only four seconds left.

267
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,843
It's your child versus mine!
The winner will be showered with praise!

268
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,513
The loser will be taunted and booed
until my throat is sore!

269
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,310
Kill her, boy! Kill her!

270
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,855
Stop him dead, little girl!

271
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,774
Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart!

272
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,944
Kill Bart! Kill Bart! Kill Bart!

273
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,493
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

274
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,708
Great game, Lis.

275
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,294
Great game, Bart.

276
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:36,225
- Tie game?!
- What the hell?!

277
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,643
This is outrageous.

278
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,688
Oh, I've never been so proud of them.

279
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:47,569
They're both losers. Losers!

280
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:50,989
- Rip off!
- We paid for blood!

281
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:52,950
Let's tear this place apart!

282
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,868
Good idea!

283
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,877
Those kids are, like, so sweet.

284
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,383
If only they had had Pee Wee
hockey when I was a lad.

285
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,010
Oh, well.
