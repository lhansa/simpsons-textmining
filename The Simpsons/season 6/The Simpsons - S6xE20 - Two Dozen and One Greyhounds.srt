00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:04,250
Two Dozen and One Greyhounds

2
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,680
Welcome to the 6:00 news,
in our brand-new studio.

3
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:35,861
Looking good, Springfield.

4
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:41,968
In today's news, a 2-ton rhino
escaped from the Springfield Zoo.

5
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:43,915
But zoo officials were quick to act...

6
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:48,177
...and Petunia, as she is known,
is safely back in captivity.

7
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:50,928
In other news, a 3-ton rhino...

8
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:53,747
...that escaped from the zoo last week
is still at large.

9
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:57,606
All right, who broke my vase?

10
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:00,324
Who took my tests off the refrigerator
and tore them up?

11
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,646
Who spread garbage all over
Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?

12
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,197
Oh, please.
This is senseless destruction...

13
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:08,411
...with none of my usual
social commentary.

14
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,975
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

15
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:17,505
I'm sure these things didn't destroy
themselves, now, did they?

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,250
Did they?

17
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:26,532
I guess Bart's not to blame.
He's lucky too...

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,660
...because it's spanking season, and
I got a hankering for some spankering.

19
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,888
I don't know why you're
so energetic today...

20
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:37,270
...but prepare to be worn out.

21
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,291
What's wrong, boy? Getting tired?

22
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:01,398
I think there's really something wrong
with Santa's Little Helper.

23
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:04,754
He was up barking all night and dug up
the back yard worse than ever.

24
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,814
- My bongo drums!
- My strobe light!

25
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:11,734
My Best of Ray Stevens,
featuring "The Streak," album.

26
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,619
So it was the dog
that buried all our stuff.

27
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:16,633
Yes, the dog.

28
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:22,170
Oh, my God! He's got
the precious cable-TV cable!

29
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,479
Always use fresh macaroni.

30
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:32,036
If the box rattles, throw it away.

31
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:37,136
Your cable TV
is experiencing difficulties.

32
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,747
Please do not panic.

33
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:41,935
Resist the temptation to read
or talk to loved ones.

34
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,814
Do not attempt sexual relations...

35
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:48,680
...as years of TV radiation have left
your genitals withered and useless.

36
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:50,156
Well, I'll be damned.

37
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,444
Excuse me. We're having
a problem with our dog.

38
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,759
I'll tell you what I'm telling
everyone else.

39
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:05,887
I'm sorry if your dog went blind, but your
gripe is with Hartz Mountain, not me.

40
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:08,638
No. No, our dog is out of control.

41
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,934
He's wild, destructive and has little
or no respect for authority.

42
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,189
Let me try a canine-human mind meld.

43
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:19,880
It's an incredibly rare psychic power
possessed only by me...

44
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:22,195
...and three other clerks at this store.

45
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:24,108
Okay.

46
00:03:28,672 --> 00:03:31,658
I'm bored. I'm restless.

47
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,638
Need change in life...

48
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:37,665
...like imported leather leash...

49
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,981
...blue contact lenses...

50
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:42,564
...200-volt-shock training collar.

51
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,323
Well, problem solved.

52
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:50,551
- Homer, hold on to the wheel!
- You got it.

53
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,377
Hey!

54
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:59,276
Don't worry. We'll catch him
or run him over trying.

55
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:02,497
He's headed to the greyhound
racing track where we found him.

56
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:05,249
Don't worry, when they find out
he doesn't have money...

57
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:08,101
...they'll throw him out.
Believe me, I know.

58
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:16,222
This place is so big.

59
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:19,309
Do you think we should split up
and look for him, Homie?

60
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:22,397
- Homie?
- Two bucks to win on number eight.

61
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:26,960
And have you seen my beloved dog?
Give me the ticket.

62
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:31,927
We can't lose.
Look at the name of the dog I bet on.

63
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:33,840
"She's the Fastest."

64
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,920
I don't think that means, necessarily...

65
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:39,343
And they're off. She's the Fastest
jumps out to an insurmountable lead.

66
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,558
You're lucky you got looks, Marge.

67
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:43,739
Around the far turn,
it's She's the Fastest.

68
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:46,524
Followed by Always Comes in Second
and I'm Number Three.

69
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:48,336
Yes! Come on, you little horse!

70
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,833
And they're in the home stretch. It's...
Wait! Another dog is on the track.

71
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,913
- Santa's Little Helper!
- The mystery dog...

72
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:58,437
...gaining fast on the outside.
Of course, he could never win this race.

73
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,417
Or could he?

74
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:10,887
What's Santa's Little Helper
doing to that dog?

75
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:14,309
Looks like he's trying to jump over her,
but he can't quite make it.

76
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:16,021
Come on, boy! You can do it!

77
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,001
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end.

78
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,316
This is the end of dog racing.

79
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:24,578
I think they're in love.

80
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,739
So that's what's been wrong
with the little fella.

81
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:36,491
He misses casual sex.

82
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:38,772
- Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom?
- Please?

83
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,994
- But she's not our dog.
- She's yours now.

84
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,981
Once they fall in love,
they lose their racing spirit.

85
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:48,336
Won't you miss her loyalty
and companionship?

86
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:54,578
Lady, you're all right.

87
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:00,511
Okay, you can go out and play.

88
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,766
But no more you-know-what
in front of the house, all right?

89
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:06,585
Hey! What did I just say?

90
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,444
Take it. It fell on the floor.

91
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,927
Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?

92
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:02,692
Me and Santa's Little Helper
used to be a team.

93
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,679
But he never wants to play anymore
since his bitch moved in.

94
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:09,538
- Don't ever say that word again.
- Well, that's what she is. I looked it up.

95
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:13,028
Well, I'm going to write the dictionary
people and have that checked.

96
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:15,142
Feels like a mistake to me.

97
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:19,974
Hey, look. A really small dog
just fell out of Santa's girlfriend.

98
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:22,457
Oh, my God! She's having babies!

99
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,779
Oh, I'm sorry, girl.
I thought you were just getting fat.

100
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:29,101
- Look, it's twins!
- No, it's two sets of twins.

101
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,283
- Two sets of twins and a triplet.
- Homer.

102
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,605
Homer, find a place
for all these little miracles.

103
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,450
Oh, my. I've never seen
anything like this.

104
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,061
How many more can there be?

105
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,142
Twenty-two.

106
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:57,323
Twenty-three.

107
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:59,168
Twenty-four.

108
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:07,994
Twenty-five.

109
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,730
Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?

110
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:41,381
Yes. We waited many years...

111
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:46,011
...but the good Lord has finally
blessed us with a real family.

112
00:08:57,186 --> 00:09:00,273
Look at Branford II. Isn't that cute?

113
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,354
He thinks he's one of the Models Inc.

114
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:08,126
Get that cat out of the way!

115
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,709
My socks.

116
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:26,146
Mom, why do I have to wear
a flea collar?

117
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:27,891
Oh, it's just easier this way.

118
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:45,005
This time...

119
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:50,777
This house stinks.

120
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:53,595
Are you just putting new newspapers
over the old ones?

121
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:56,280
Do you have a better idea?

122
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:59,904
Now, I know we love the puppies
very much...

123
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:02,320
...but I think they're getting
to be a problem.

124
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:05,709
Yeah, they ate all my socks.
I have to wear Lisa's to school today.

125
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:09,166
- How do you explain the culottes, boy?
- I have to coordinate, don't I?

126
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,615
We've been thinking about
giving the puppies away.

127
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:14,032
- No!
- Mainly your mother.

128
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:15,844
Is that what we do in this family?

129
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:19,266
When someone becomes an
inconvenience, we just get rid of them?

130
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:27,085
Hello? Is anybody there?

131
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:33,260
All right, we'll give the dogs
one more chance.

132
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:37,589
As long as the puppies don't do
anything else wrong, they stay.

133
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,535
On a completely unrelated topic...

134
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:42,421
...I'm having a very, very important
dinner party tonight.

135
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,568
Splendid. Who's coming?

136
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:47,219
Reverend Lovejoy,
your old Army drill sergeant...

137
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:50,072
...and the regional director of the IRS.

138
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:54,401
Oh, just lovely, Marge.

139
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:57,152
The whole town will hear
what a perfect evening this was.

140
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,568
- How nothing at all went wrong.
- Simpson.

141
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:02,454
This evening has gone so flawlessly,
I'm gonna forget...

142
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:05,072
...that you were mistakenly
let out of the Army early.

143
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,421
I'm so impressed
by this problem-free evening...

144
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,750
...that there's no need for that audit.
- A toast to the Simpsons.

145
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,278
And to the delectable turkey...

146
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:17,030
...that's walking around the table!

147
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,178
Dear Lord, it's a demon bird.

148
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:30,285
Simpson! See you at reveille,
0500 tomorrow.

149
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:32,399
See you at the IRS.

150
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,278
See you in hell.

151
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:35,453
From heaven.

152
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:44,949
Well, we sure could use a pooch
to guard the flock at the Flanderosa.

153
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:48,574
It'd be nice to have some companionship
when Mother goes out on dates.

154
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,956
We could use a new pet
over at the home...

155
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:55,151
...seeing how we accidentally
killed that smart-mouthed bird.

156
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:01,527
They don't like being broken up.

157
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:03,674
We've got to be realistic, kids.

158
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:07,500
Who's gonna have a big enough heart
to take care of 25 puppies?

159
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:12,466
And I know the little fellas would love
romping around my many acres...

160
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,077
...chasing my many cars...

161
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:16,795
...drinking from my many toilets.
- Who wouldn't?

162
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:21,023
Mom, don't give the puppies to him.
He'll be mean to them.

163
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:25,151
She's right, Homer. There's
something about his face I don't trust.

164
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,761
I'm sorry, Mr. Burns...

165
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:36,325
...but you can't have these dogs.
Am I fired?

166
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,506
Oh, of course not.

167
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,822
They're your pets.
You can do as you wish.

168
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:42,466
Good day, everyone.

169
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:48,708
- My, he certainly took that well.
- A little too well, if you ask me.

170
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:52,667
I'm sure he's plotting some
brilliant scheme to get those puppies.

171
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:57,533
There you go. There you go. You too.

172
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,963
Honestly, sir, you don't put the effort
into your schemes that you used to.

173
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:14,336
Don't worry, folks,
we'll find your wallet.

174
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:18,464
Dogs. Chief, you're getting
powdered sugar all over my floor.

175
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,880
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

176
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,934
I'm dusting for prints.

177
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:25,611
We don't have to wait for cops.

178
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,095
Who can track them better
than their mom and dad?

179
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:30,007
Let's go find your babies.

180
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,739
Dinner's on, dogs.

181
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:40,578
I'm sorry, kids. I don't think we're
ever gonna find your greyhounds.

182
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:44,907
Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you
one of the 25 he got last night.

183
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,356
Who knows what horrible things he's
doing to those innocent little puppies.

184
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:16,786
There. Now, wasn't that heavenly?
And don't you feel better too?

185
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,303
He's giving them a bath.

186
00:14:19,638 --> 00:14:21,081
There you are.

187
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:24,236
There you go, little fella. And you.

188
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,276
Smithers, look. He's standing up.

189
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,806
I've never seen anything so adorable.
You know who it reminds me of?

190
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,316
- Benji?
- No.

191
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:37,927
- Lassie?
- No, no.

192
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:40,712
- A person. You know who I mean.
- Snoop Doggy Dogg?

193
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,632
- Bob Barker? David Brenner?
- No, no.

194
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,786
The person who's always
standing and walking.

195
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,605
- Rory Calhoun?
- That's it!

196
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:53,833
You stay with me.
You're the pick of the litter.

197
00:14:57,122 --> 00:15:00,309
Maybe we were wrong about Burns
on this one.

198
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:04,773
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this, sir?

199
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,323
You do have a very full wardrobe
as it is.

200
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:12,222
Yes. But not completely full.
For, you see:

201
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,175
Some men hunt for sport

202
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:17,558
Others hunt for food

203
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:22,189
The only thing I'm hunting for

204
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,531
Is an outfit that looks good

205
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:35,779
See my vest
See my vest

206
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:37,759
Made from real gorilla chest

207
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:41,719
Feel this sweater, there's no better
Than authentic Irish setter

208
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:44,180
See this hat
'Twas my cat

209
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,462
My evening wear, vampire bat

210
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:50,220
These white slippers
Are albino African endangered rhino

211
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:54,113
Grizzly-bear underwear
Turtles ' necks, I've got my share

212
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:57,872
Beret of poodle
On my noodle it shall rest

213
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:01,898
Try my red-robin suit
It comes one breast or two

214
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,744
See my vest
See my vest

215
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,925
See my vest

216
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:13,811
Like my loafers?
Former gophers

217
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,160
It was that or skin my chauffeurs

218
00:16:16,328 --> 00:16:19,549
But a greyhound-fur tuxedo
Would be best

219
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:23,039
- So let's prepare these dogs
- Kill two for matching clogs

220
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:26,194
See my vest
See my vest

221
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:33,006
Oh, please, won 't you see my vest?

222
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:36,059
- I really like the vest.
- I gathered, yeah.

223
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,952
He's gonna make a tuxedo
out of our puppies.

224
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:44,180
- Bart.
- Sorry. You gotta admit, it's catchy.

225
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:47,737
Come on, Smithers. Let's go
finish the little flea circuses off.

226
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:51,294
Except for little Monty, of course.

227
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:55,086
We gotta get the dogs out of there.

228
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:01,697
- Hush, puppies.
- We gotta get you out of here.

229
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:10,455
I know. The window.

230
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,710
- No. What are you doing?
- Dogs always land on their feet.

231
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:16,361
- That's cats.
- No, it's dogs. I'll prove it.

232
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:20,556
Best two out of three.

233
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,992
Bart, look. A laundry chute.

234
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,308
Okay, guys. Let's move.

235
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,435
Come on, come on.

236
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,851
I've got an idea.

237
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:53,174
Sorry, Monty,
but you're too big for this ride.

238
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:01,395
- Quick, let's get the...
- Going somewhere?

239
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:04,449
That's impossible.
How did you get here first?

240
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,133
Oh, there'll be plenty of time
for explanations later.

241
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:08,811
Right now, I'll be taking
my puppies back.

242
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,469
But they're ours.
You stole them from us.

243
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:15,690
Here's a phone.
Call somebody who cares.

244
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,012
Give me that.
Now, if you'll excuse us, children...

245
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:21,965
...the pups have a date
with a fashion knife.

246
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,565
There. Now you don't know
which one's little Monty.

247
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:32,096
If you don't want him to be part of your
tuxedo, you'll let the other dogs go too.

248
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:35,988
Nice try.
Come on, little Monty. Stand up.

249
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:39,378
Come on, stand up. Do your trick.

250
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,223
No. Don't. Stay down, Monty.

251
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:44,982
- Stay down. Stay down, boy.
- No. Don't get up. Good boy.

252
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:46,693
Excellent.

253
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:57,700
Now it's simply a matter
of bending down...

254
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,485
...and picking up the one and only...

255
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,418
This can't be happening.
They're all standing.

256
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:07,935
I can't tell them apart.

257
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,955
All right, you win.

258
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:13,505
- I'll have to kill them all.
- No!

259
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:18,035
But they're so wretchedly adorable.

260
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:21,391
Twenty-five little Rory Calhouns.

261
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,002
I can't do it.

262
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:24,847
But I can kill you.

263
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,310
No, I can't kill you either.

264
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:33,337
Look at you, standing there
on your hind legs...

265
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,955
...like a couple of Rory Calhouns.

266
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:42,196
Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly
of killing innocent animals for fashion.

267
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:47,331
I have, I have. I swear, I'll never wear
any clothing made from an animal...

268
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:49,612
...that can do an amusing trick.

269
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,069
Another victory for Montgomery Burns '
champion greyhounds.

270
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:56,317
Twenty-five dogs,
25 world champions...

271
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:59,237
...which so far have earned
their owner over $ 10 million.

272
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:02,492
I'll bet whoever gave him those dogs
is kicking themselves now.

273
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:07,827
Homer! For the love of God, no!

274
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,163
Marge, you know that batting
this light bulb is the only thing...

275
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:17,357
...that cheers me up after giving away
those million-dollar greyhounds.
