1
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:05,173
Another Simpsons Clip Show

2
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,577
This romance is
so full of heartfelt passion.

3
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:41,348
I can really identify with
this corn-fed heroine.

4
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:43,250
Homer, are you awake?

5
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,687
This is important.
Give me some sign you're awake.

6
00:00:46,688 --> 00:00:48,990
- Wake up!
- What's wrong?

7
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,260
House run away? Dog's on fire?

8
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:54,864
Homie, do you think that the romance
has gone out of our lives?

9
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:57,767
Wake up!

10
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,437
Marge, it's 3 a.m.,
and I worked all day.

11
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:03,040
It's 9:30 p.m., and you spent
your whole Saturday...

12
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:05,376
...drinking beer
in Maggie's kiddie pool.

13
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:08,447
There you are.

14
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,015
Thought you could get away, huh?

15
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,434
Homer, young people learn
about love from adults.

16
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:17,672
We've been setting a terrible example
for our children and the community.

17
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:21,609
I want us to deal with the issues
raised by this book.

18
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,880
We shouldn't have put
a fireplace in the bedroom.

19
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,913
How many times can you laugh
at that cat getting hit by the moon?

20
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:03,381
It's a new episode.

21
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:06,184
Not exactly. They pieced it
together from old shows.

22
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,620
And it seems new to the trusting eyes
of impressionable youth.

23
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,556
- Really?
- Ren & Stimpy do it all the time.

24
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:16,126
Yes, and when was the last you heard
anyone talk about Ren & Stimpy?

25
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:19,596
Children, your father and I
have fed you and clothed you...

26
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:22,432
...but we've neglected
something more important.

27
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,667
It's time to learn about love.

28
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:26,669
No need. We already learned in school.

29
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:28,738
This is Fuzzy Bunny.

30
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:33,609
About a year ago he noticed his voice
was changing. He had terrible acne...

31
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:39,481
...and had fur where there was no fur
before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny.

32
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:41,416
Boring.

33
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:45,487
Fuzzy went to the park,
the ice-cream social, the boat show...

34
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:49,824
...and other wholesome activities.
They never ruined their fun...

35
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:53,194
...by giving in to their throbbing
biological urges.

36
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:56,465
Then came the big day.

37
00:02:56,632 --> 00:03:01,336
Fluffy and Fuzzy got married.
That night came the honeymoon.

38
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:04,472
She's faking it.

39
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:07,775
I mean romance, not love.

40
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:09,177
Mom, romance is dead.

41
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:12,246
It was acquired in a hostile takeover
by Hallmark and Disney...

42
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:15,049
...homogenized and sold off
piece by piece.

43
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:19,453
That's not true! Romance is
all around us, in our neighborhoods.

44
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,756
Even at our jobs.

45
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,302
All you have to do is think about
your most cherished memories.

46
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:39,638
- Moe's Tavern.
- Hello, is Al there?

47
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:42,441
- AI?
- Yeah, Al. Last name, Coholic.

48
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,976
Let me check.

49
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:46,678
Phone call for Al.
Al Coholic.

50
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,880
Jock Strap.

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,815
Is I.P. Freely here?

52
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:54,452
Hey, is there a Butts here?
Seymour Butts?

53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,588
Homer Sexual!
Mike Rotch!

54
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,357
Amanda Huggenkiss!

55
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:01,726
Hugh Jass.
Ivana Tinkle.

56
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:05,062
I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face
and a big butt...

57
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:08,899
...and my butt smells
and I like to kiss my own butt.

58
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,434
No, no!

59
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:15,638
No, ask your heart
what its fondest desire is.

60
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,309
Chocolate.

61
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:23,211
Invisible cola.

62
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,147
Forbidden donut.

63
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:28,113
No, think about people...

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,017
...about moments in your life
that have been very romantic.

65
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:33,219
Oh, okay.

66
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:40,027
That's not the idea at all.

67
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:46,201
Okay. Well, this story isn't ideal.
I've never told it to you before.

68
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:50,773
I got a thoughtless birthday present from
someone who shall remain nameless.

69
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,446
I went to the bowling alley
to spite him. Or her.

70
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,697
- I'm awfully sorry.
- Entirely my fault.

71
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,432
It is nice to meet you...

72
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,102
...Homer.

73
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:21,075
No, no. Homer is my
ball's name. I'm Marge.

74
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:31,852
Your fingers are slender, so feminine.
They're too tapered for this ball.

75
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:35,255
You need something lighter,
more delicate.

76
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:40,180
- Here, use my ball.
- No, thank you, Mister... Brunswick.

77
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,543
- Call me Jacques.
- Jacques.

78
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,064
Marge.

79
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,147
May I ask you a bold question?

80
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:49,029
- Sure.
- You've never bowled?

81
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,470
- Never.
- No.

82
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,873
- No.
- Then I will teach you.

83
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:56,116
- I don't want to trouble you.
- Not at all. I'm a professional.

84
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:58,398
Roll the ball, Marge.
Let me see your form.

85
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,481
All right.
But I'm not very good.

86
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:07,648
I can hit the one pin, but
the rest of them don't even wobble.

87
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,930
I can help you, Marge.
Pick up the ball.

88
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,332
Pick up Homer. Pick him up.

89
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:15,856
- Now throw.
- But...

90
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,018
Throw, damn you.

91
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,625
You're a very good teacher.

92
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,549
- Here we are.
- You didn't have to drop me off.

93
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,070
But I wanted to.

94
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,154
Marge, do you know how beautiful
you look in the moonlight?

95
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:37,638
- Jacques, I'm a married woman.
- I know, I know.

96
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:42,963
My mind says stop, but my heart
and my hips cry, "Proceed!"

97
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,326
Darling, I want to see you tomorrow.

98
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,649
- Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
- What's brunch?

99
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:51,251
You'd love it. It's not quite
breakfast or lunch...

100
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,334
...but it comes with a slice of
cantaloupe at the end.

101
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:58,098
You don't get what you would at
breakfast, but you get a good meal.

102
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:00,420
He seemed to know a lot
about brunch.

103
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:03,503
But it turned out he wasn't
interested in brunch at all.

104
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:09,269
Your laughter is like music but if you
laugh at what I say next, I will die.

105
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,073
For I am about to say something
very serious, perhaps shocking.

106
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:16,637
Marge, my darling, I want
you to meet with me again.

107
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:19,880
- That doesn't shock me.
- Away from prying eyes.

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,363
At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.

109
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:27,848
Marge, speak to me!

110
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,410
Is Thursday okay?

111
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:45,706
Thank goodness I drove
down that ironic street.

112
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:51,552
I made the right decision to stay with
my Homie, and there was no harm done.

113
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:56,276
So if you mentally snip out the part
where I already had a husband...

114
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,719
...that's my idea of romance.

115
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,842
Marge, I want you
to stop seeing this Jacques.

116
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:03,403
You can let him down gently...

117
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:07,087
...but over the next couple of months,
I want you to break it off.

118
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,849
Okay, Homer.

119
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,931
That was a close one, kids.

120
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:17,297
Okay, Marge. As long as
we're traumatizing the kids...

121
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:20,340
...I have a scandalous story
of my own.

122
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:24,745
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
your new coworker, Mindy Simmons.

123
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,947
She has a degree in engineering
or something.

124
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,268
Hi. How's it going?

125
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:30,190
- Oh, pleased to meet you.
- Yeah, ditto.

126
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,672
Hi.

127
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:37,477
Homer, what's the matter?

128
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:40,561
Ain't you never seen a naked chick
riding a clam before?

129
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:43,083
Gotta go!

130
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:51,451
I made it the whole day
without seeing her again.

131
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:54,895
I mean, "Hello!"

132
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,097
I guess we'll be going down together.

133
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,740
- I mean, getting off togeth... I mean...
- That's okay.

134
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,503
I'll just push the button for
the stimulator... I mean, elevator.

135
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:07,027
Think unsexy thoughts, think unsexy
thoughts, think unsexy thoughts.

136
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:16,476
Well, this is my floor.

137
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,321
See you tomorrow!

138
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:24,845
I tried to avoid her, but we were
sent to a nuclear convention together.

139
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,812
TV's there. Bathroom's there.

140
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,174
And there's your king-size bed for:

141
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:42,743
- Hubba-hubba.
- Stop that.

142
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:47,346
I love my wife and family. All I'll use
this bed for is sleeping, eating...

143
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:50,029
...and maybe building a little fort.
That's it!

144
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:54,954
Homer, I got a really wicked idea
that could get us into a lot of trouble.

145
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:59,719
- Mindy. We have to fight our temptation.
- No, Homer.

146
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,440
Let's do it.

147
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,402
Let's call room service!

148
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,368
I was doing my best to resist her...

149
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,252
...but at dinner, the fortune cookie
predicted doom.

150
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:17,217
"You will find happiness
with a new love."

151
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:21,221
- This was a really nice night, Homer.
- Yeah, yeah.

152
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:27,027
- What's wrong?
- Oh, yeah, like you don't know.

153
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,990
We're gonna have sex.

154
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,234
- Well, we don't have to.
- Yes, we do.

155
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,156
The cookie told me so.

156
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:39,359
Well, desserts aren't always right.

157
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,041
But they're so sweet.

158
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,803
Homer...

159
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:45,686
...you know how I feel.

160
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:48,368
So it's up to you.

161
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:53,053
Look in your heart.
I think you'll see what you want.

162
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:09,229
Oh, baby.

163
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,634
This was a wonderful idea, Homie.

164
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:17,157
- What happened to Mindy?
- Yes, what did happen to her?

165
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:19,520
She hit the bottle hard
and lost her job.

166
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,283
Good. Does anyone else
have a love story?

167
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:27,648
Yes, I do. And just like your love stories,
it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings...

168
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:29,489
...and scars that will never heal.

169
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,492
It started, appropriately enough,
with an innocent boy...

170
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,495
...being embarrassed
on Valentine's Day.

171
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,262
Poor Ralph.

172
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:45,025
Here you go, Ralph.

173
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:50,631
- You "choo-choo-choose" me?
- Happy Valentine's.

174
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:57,277
It was an unusually warm
February 14th...

175
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,920
...so the children walked home
without jackets.

176
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,604
Can I walk you home, valentine?

177
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,205
Sure, I guess.

178
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:09,009
That valentine sure was funny.

179
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:10,651
Glad you liked it.

180
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:16,456
It says "choo-choo-choose" me,
and there's a picture of a train.

181
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:18,979
Yeah, nice gag.

182
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,743
So...

183
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:26,186
...do you like stuff?

184
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:33,954
The doctor said I wouldn't have so many
nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of it.

185
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:36,877
Well, here's my house.

186
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:46,406
Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph.

187
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,131
A Malibu Stacy convertible!

188
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:54,655
"Look in the tunk."
He must mean "trunk."

189
00:12:57,538 --> 00:13:00,220
Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show!

190
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,584
It's the Krusty the Clown
29th Anniversary Show!

191
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:09,109
Thank you, thank you!

192
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:13,153
- Lisa, you want a bite of my ice cream?
- No, thanks.

193
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,676
Send it this way, boy.

194
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,520
Nothing gets chocolate out. See?

195
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,840
Now, for my favorite part
of the show...

196
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,920
What does that say?
"Talk to the audience"?

197
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,880
Oh, God, this is always death.
All right.

198
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,160
Oh, no. Please don't
show me with Ralph.

199
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
- What's your name, son?
- Ralph.

200
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
- And is this your girlfriend, Ralph?
- Yes!

201
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,080
I love Lisa Simpson! And when
I grow up, I'm going to marry her.

202
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,520
No!

203
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,840
Now, you listen to me!
I don't like you! I never liked you!

204
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,000
The only reason I gave you
that valentine...

205
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,280
...is because nobody else would!

206
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,520
Watch this. You can actually pinpoint
the second when his heart rips in half.

207
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,040
And now!

208
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Lisa, not all romances
turn out that way.

209
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,040
Bart, do you have a love story
that doesn't end in heartbreak?

210
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,720
Yes, I do.

211
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,480
The only girl I ever loved
invited me up to the tree house.

212
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,600
She had something
very important to tell me.

213
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,120
I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone.

214
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,880
I have a boyfriend.

215
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,280
You won't be needing this.

216
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,920
Wait, that did end in heartbreak.

217
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,480
Thanks for opening up
old wounds, Ma.

218
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,280
Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say:

219
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,040
"There's a whole lot of frowning
going on."

220
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,620
Mom, doesn't any love story
have a happy ending?

221
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,700
Of course. Remember when...

222
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,740
...your Aunt Selma got married?

223
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,660
- Good.
- Soon I will kill you.

224
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,340
Wait, wait, that's no good.

225
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,660
I know. Your grandfather, remember?

226
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,420
It started on an outing for dinner.

227
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,020
Say, I've got a neat idea.

228
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Why don't you go in and pick up
my mother, and we'll go out to dinner.

229
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,940
I'll be back in a jiffy.

230
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,980
That's not my mother.

231
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,580
I'll be back in a jiffy.

232
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,140
Can I come too?

233
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,060
They hit it off right away, but there
were rivals for the fair lady's hand.

234
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,300
My favorite song. This is so nice.

235
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,460
I can't remember when I've felt
this young.

236
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,220
I really can't.

237
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,020
Say, sport, mind if I have
the next dance?

238
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,060
What the...? Don't sneak up on a...
Aren't you...?

239
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,900
No need for the blown gasket, Charlie.
I'll have her back in one piece.

240
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,020
But in the end, just when things
looked worst, true love triumphed.

241
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,380
Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier,
take this man...

242
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,620
...to be your lawfully wedded husband?

243
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,820
Oh, Monty, my favorite song.
How did...?

244
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,740
I specifically requested
no romantic music. What...?

245
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,460
Mrs. Bouvier!

246
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,420
Mrs. Bouvier!

247
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,420
Mrs. Bouvier!

248
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,980
Honey, are you sure you wanna be
Mrs. Montgomery Burns?

249
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,620
Wouldn't you rather be
Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?

250
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,140
No.

251
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,980
- I don't wanna be either.
- Hot diggety damn!

252
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,220
That's good enough for me.

253
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,360
That doesn't seem like a happy ending.

254
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,720
That seems more like a detached tale
of modern alienation.

255
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,080
I give up. Did anybody learn
anything about love tonight?

256
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah, learned it screws everybody up.

257
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,320
Well, there's that side of it.
But there's also...

258
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,920
Help me out here, Lisa.

259
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,040
Sorry, Mom. I've decided
to save my love...

260
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,320
...for someone who's guaranteed
not to reject me. Soon, Cory, soon.

261
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,320
Well, kids, I tried.

262
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,840
- But maybe you're right.
- Wait a minute, Marge.

263
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,920
Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe
I'm no expert on the subject...

264
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,920
...but there was one time
I got it right.

265
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,840
Artie, I don't know. It was a
beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it.

266
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,360
- Just this.
- Artie, please.

267
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,280
- Come on, kiss me. Please.
- No, really, I mean it! Now stop it!

268
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
- I'm sorry, Marge.
- Take me home.

269
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,480
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
tell anybody about my busy hands.

270
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,840
Not so much for myself,
but I'm so respected...

271
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,040
...it would damage the town
to hear it. Good night.

272
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,800
Yeah, right.

273
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,720
Shut up! I'm over as far as I can go!

274
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,480
All right! All right!
I'll walk in the mud!

275
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,000
- Homer?
- Marge?

276
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,720
- Yeah. You want a ride?
- Sure.

277
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,620
When I got home, I realized
who I should've gone with.

278
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,660
Who?

279
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,140
- Hi, prom date.
- Marge, pour vous.

280
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,940
- Why so glum?
- I got a problem.

281
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,140
Once you stop this car,
I'm gonna hug you and kiss you...

282
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,660
...and I'll never let you go.

283
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,300
Your first kiss.

284
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,660
But not the last.

285
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,540
Homie.

286
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,700
See, kids? That's what I meant
by romance.
