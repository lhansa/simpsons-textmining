1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,349
Homer the Great

2
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:38,074
- Looks like you got a leak.
- Could you start fixing it?

3
00:00:38,242 --> 00:00:42,839
The basement is getting awfully flooded.
And I think the cat's down there.

4
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:47,537
Yeah, I probably won't be able to get
the parts I need for two, three weeks.

5
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:49,685
And that's if I order them today.

6
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:53,040
- Which I won't.
- Oh, dear.

7
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,899
Emergency call. Gotta go.

8
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:01,128
- What should we do until you get back?
- Put a pan down there.

9
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:06,899
It didn't work.

10
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:12,503
Lousy traffic jams.

11
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,523
The traffic report will
get me out of this one.

12
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:17,537
This is Ernie Pie.

13
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:22,604
We got a little accident that's backing
traffic up as far as this reporter can see.

14
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,242
Hi, Dad.

15
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:43,443
Hey, how come you guys
got such great parking places?

16
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:46,329
- It's a secret.
- Shut up.

17
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:57,906
All right, Econo-Save,
you just made the list.

18
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:04,785
Hey, will you guys help me fix my...?

19
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:10,255
Hey, how come you guys
got better chairs than me?

20
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:13,040
- It's a secret.
- Shut up.

21
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,658
Hey, you guys
wanna go bowling tonight?

22
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:23,376
- No, we're busy.
- Yeah, we got things to do.

23
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,289
Like what?

24
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,537
It's a secret.

25
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:29,785
Shut up.

26
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,946
So Lenny and Carl are never
around on Wednesdays.

27
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:36,765
They don't tell me where they go.
It's like a conspiracy.

28
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:40,859
A conspiracy, eh? You think they're
involved in the Kennedy assassination?

29
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,376
I do now.

30
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:46,128
I'm gonna follow them tonight
and see where they go.

31
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:50,456
Oh, Homer, don't start stalking
people again. It's so illegal.

32
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:53,846
You stalked Charles Kuralt because
you thought he dug up your garden.

33
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:57,403
- Well, something did.
- I don't want you stalking anyone.

34
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,987
Oh, okay.
Have it your own way, Marge.

35
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:01,832
I'll be back in a minute.

36
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:05,020
I'm going outside...

37
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,671
...to stalk...

38
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:10,691
...Lenny and Carl...

39
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:30,154
All I have to do
is follow the yellow-drip road.

40
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,349
- There's our secret meeting place.
- Yes. Let's go inside.

41
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:42,329
Sounds good.

42
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:59,644
I can see everything
and they're none the wiser.

43
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,859
- An intruder!
- He will pay the ultimate price.

44
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,510
Yes, the ultimate price.

45
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,396
Get out of here!

46
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:22,362
I saw weird stuff
in that place last night.

47
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:27,396
Weird, strange, sick, twisted, eerie,
godless, evil stuff. And I want in.

48
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:29,745
We don't know what
you're talking about, Homer.

49
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:32,396
You can't join the Stonecutters.
It's too exclusive.

50
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,007
Oh, well.

51
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,792
That was a real nice
secret organization we had once.

52
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,638
Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?

53
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,617
There are two ways
to gain membership:

54
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,832
- Be the son of a Stonecutter.
- Next.

55
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,846
Or save the life of a Stonecutter.

56
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:46,423
Hey!

57
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,054
I saved your life. That egg sandwich
could've killed you by cholesterol.

58
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:54,711
Forget it, Homer. While it has been
established eggs contain cholesterol...

59
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,564
...it has not been proven
that they raise the level...

60
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,081
...of serum cholesterol
in the human bloodstream.

61
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:02,262
Those Egg Council creeps
got to you too?

62
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:06,221
Oh, you got it all wrong, Homer.
It's not like that.

63
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:09,342
You'd better run, egg!

64
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,523
Why don't people like me, Marge?

65
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:14,477
Everyone likes you.
You're a wonderful person.

66
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:17,664
Why don't those stupid idiots
let me in their crappy club for jerks?

67
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:20,282
- I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer.
- It is.

68
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:23,000
It's been happening to me all my life.

69
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:28,940
Hey, Billy, hey, Joey, come on in.
There's plenty of room.

70
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,893
- Sorry. Not you, Homer.
- Why not?

71
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:36,456
But you let in Homer Glumpet.

72
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:39,577
It says "no Homers."

73
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,188
We're allowed to have one.

74
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,148
I felt so left out.

75
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:49,745
- Kids can be so cruel.
- We can? Thanks, Mom.

76
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:52,329
Cut it out, Bart!

77
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,181
I'd give anything
to get into the Stonecutters.

78
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:58,530
- What do they do there, Dad?
- I'm a member.

79
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:01,315
What do they do?
What don't they do?

80
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,832
Oh, they do so many things,
they never stop.

81
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:07,993
- Oh, the things they do there. My stars.
- You don't know what they do, do you?

82
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:10,107
- Not as such, no.
- I'm a Stonecutter.

83
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:13,866
Remember those self-hypnosis classes
we took to help us ignore Grampa?

84
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:17,087
Do I ever. It's five years later
and I still think I'm a chicken.

85
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,436
- I'm a chicken, Marge.
- I know, I know.

86
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,450
Maybe we should be
listening to him now.

87
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,396
I'm a member!

88
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:25,242
- What?
- What?

89
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:27,389
You're a member of
the Stonecutters, Grampa?

90
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:29,772
Oh, sure. Let's see.

91
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,993
I'm an Elk, a Mason, a Communist.

92
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:37,020
I'm the president of the Gay & Lesbian
Alliance, for some reason.

93
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:40,242
Here it is. The Stonecutters.

94
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,020
This is it. My ticket in.

95
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:44,638
They have to let me join
if I'm the son of a member.

96
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,154
I'll take this Communist one too.

97
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:50,879
Coming through. Can't throw me out.
My father's a member.

98
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:53,463
- I'm in, I'm in.
- Okay, okay, Homer, you're in.

99
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,275
Just don't point that thing at me.

100
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:58,463
Thanks, Lenny.
When am I gonna be initiated?

101
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:01,987
- As soon as Number One gets here.
- Number One?

102
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,839
What kind of stupid
wiener name is that?

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,436
"Hello, my name is Number One."

104
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:11,383
And so forth.

105
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:12,993
We call each other by number.

106
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:16,215
Carl is Number 14, I'm Number 12.
Burnsie is Number 29.

107
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,732
- You outrank Mr. Burns here?
- Sure. Watch.

108
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,651
Hey, 29, get over here!

109
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,718
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

110
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:32,456
Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder.

111
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,584
- Is he the leader?
- Of this chapter.

112
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,805
There are chapters all over the world.
And it has been foretold...

113
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:41,819
...that someday a Chosen One will...

114
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,403
Okay, okay. I didn't ask
for your life story.

115
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:49,940
Let the initiation begin.

116
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:53,161
All Stonecutters must take
the Leap of Faith.

117
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:58,161
If you survive this five-story plunge,
your character will be proven.

118
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,745
Happy landings!

119
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,685
I think I have to do it again.
My blindfold came off.

120
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,745
This ritual is called
Crossing the Desert.

121
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:27,550
And this we call the Unblinking Eye.

122
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,584
Hey, have you ever noticed
that the Crossing the Desert...

123
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:34,430
...is a lot like the Unblinking Eye?

124
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,779
And exactly like
the Wreck of the Hesperus.

125
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,658
And now the final ordeal:

126
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:42,617
The Paddling of the Swollen Ass,
with paddles.

127
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:50,067
And by the sacred parchment,
I swear that if I reveal the secrets...

128
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,852
...of the Stonecutters,
may my stomach become bloated...

129
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:56,409
...and my head be plucked
of all but three hairs.

130
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:58,389
He should have to take
a different oath.

131
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,336
Everyone takes the same oath.

132
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:02,987
Welcome to the club, Number 908.

133
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:05,805
You have joined the Sacred Order
of the Stonecutters...

134
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:08,960
...who since ancient times
have split the rocks of ignorance...

135
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:11,678
...that obscure the light
of knowledge and truth.

136
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,228
Now let's all get drunk
and play Ping-Pong.

137
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,685
He's already kind of heavy,
you know, and...

138
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:23,297
Well, to be honest, I never got around
to ordering that part for you.

139
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,881
So it's still gonna be
a couple of weeks.

140
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:28,901
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

141
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,719
- Really?
- Yes. Yes.

142
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:35,646
But what if I were to shake your hand
in this way?

143
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:41,686
Well, I didn't realize
you were a member.

144
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,149
So long, suckers.

145
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:05,176
- Same old space, huh, Dad?
- Yep.

146
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:10,679
But they gave me these Rollerblades
so I can glide to the front door.

147
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:15,511
Sweet.

148
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,686
- Jealous?
- Well, no. We've got the same chair.

149
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,297
You're jealous.

150
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:26,585
- Your membership pack.
- What's this?

151
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:29,236
You put that on your car
so you won't get any tickets.

152
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:31,787
This keeps paramedics
from stealing your wallet.

153
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:35,579
Oh, and don't bother calling 911
anymore. Here's the real number.

154
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:41,464
Homer, a man who called himself
"you know who"...

155
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:45,021
...just invited you to a secret
"wink-wink" at the "you know what."

156
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:47,438
Sure are popular
now that you're a Stonecutter.

157
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:52,605
Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts,
keggers, stein hoist...

158
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,585
...AA meetings, beer night.

159
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:59,518
It's wonderful, Marge. I've never
felt so accepted in all my life.

160
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:01,934
These people look
deep within my soul...

161
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:06,733
...and assign me a number
based on the order in which I joined.

162
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:14,954
Who controls the British crown?
Who keeps the metric system down?

163
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:19,048
We do
We do

164
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:23,243
Who leaves Atlantis off the maps?
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

165
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:26,968
We do
We do

166
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,230
Who holds back the electric car?

167
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:35,458
Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?

168
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:39,552
We do
We do

169
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:43,579
Who robs cavefish of their sight?
Who rigs every Oscar night?

170
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,733
We do

171
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:50,558
We do

172
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:53,478
Thank you. Tonight we are here...

173
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,303
...to commemorate our glorious
society's 1500th anniversary.

174
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:00,256
And in honor of this
momentous occasion...

175
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:03,813
...we're having ribs.
- Yeah!

176
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:10,357
I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt,
I could lose the respect of my brethren.

177
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:12,370
So let us rejoice and enjoy our meal...

178
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:17,605
...in the shadow of the hallowed
sacred parchment.

179
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:23,881
- Homer.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, Lenny.

180
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:26,532
This is just appalling and outrageous.

181
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,847
What? Did I miss something?

182
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:32,270
Oh, God!

183
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:35,089
No, Homer, no! This is outrageous!
You can't do that!

184
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,142
- No!
- You really are stupid.

185
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,324
And the official Stonecutter
underwear too.

186
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:54,686
Please don't kick me out.
This society's everything to me.

187
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,639
Please give me another chance.
I've learned my lesson!

188
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:00,122
I've learned my lesson!

189
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:02,807
That's it!

190
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:05,055
- How can we punish him further?
- Oh, sorry.

191
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:10,419
Homer Simpson, for your continuing
and baffling desecration...

192
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:12,836
...of our beloved sacred parchment...

193
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:16,628
...you are hereby banished
from the Stonecutters forever.

194
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:21,124
And as a final humiliation,
you must walk home naked...

195
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:25,117
...dragging behind you
the Stone of Shame.

196
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,017
The mark!

197
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:39,950
Oh, that. It's just a birthmark.
And I'll thank you not to stare.

198
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,735
He's the Chosen One.

199
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:46,695
You are the Chosen One...

200
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:51,292
...whom the sacred parchment
prophesied would lead us to glory.

201
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:55,487
Now to the top of Mount Springfield
for the coronation.

202
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:58,742
Remove the Stone of Shame.

203
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:02,802
Attach the Stone of Triumph!

204
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:20,889
Mental note: Don't overdo this.

205
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,507
Peekaboo!

206
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,218
I always wondered
if there was a God.

207
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:38,138
And now I know.
There is, and it's me.

208
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:42,030
- You're not a god, Homer.
- Remember, Dad, all glory is fleeting.

209
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:45,017
- So?
- Beware the Ides of March.

210
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,795
- No.
- I know you're happy now...

211
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:49,681
...but it won't last forever.
- Everything lasts forever.

212
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:54,077
Getting what you want all the time
will leave you unfulfilled and joyless.

213
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:55,520
Remove the girl.

214
00:14:55,722 --> 00:15:00,117
You're not with your Stonecutters. There
are no lackeys around to carry out your...

215
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,211
Another strike for the Chosen One!

216
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,292
Hurrah!

217
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,815
That's just an excellent break.

218
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:22,518
- Oh, most assuredly.
- Absolutely.

219
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,860
- I'm out.
- No, no, no. Homer...

220
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:34,997
...you have a royal sampler.

221
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:38,167
Oh, I win again, don't I?

222
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,936
- Good one.
- Nice hand, Chosen One.

223
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:43,338
You know, I think you guys
are letting me win.

224
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:46,975
No! No! No!

225
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:49,478
From now on I want you
to be honest with me.

226
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:51,446
I mean, I'm not perfect, right?

227
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:56,752
- Yeah.
- Well...

228
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:02,558
Run.

229
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:12,765
The grand exalted leader
requests a moment of your time.

230
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,401
Class dismissed.

231
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:21,941
Lisa, you were right.
My happiness is fading.

232
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:25,745
You're experiencing spiritual emptiness
because your power has isolated you...

233
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:29,549
...from other human beings.
- What do you mean, isolated?

234
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:35,355
Well, maybe you could reach out to
the community and help other people.

235
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:38,358
I could help others.

236
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:43,830
I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them
up and make them reenact the Civil War.

237
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:45,598
Dad, that doesn't help people.

238
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:48,968
Couldn't hurt. Unless the monkeys
started hurting people.

239
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:51,571
Which they almost certainly would.

240
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:58,677
Brothers. Brothers!

241
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:03,982
Brothers, I've learned
a wonderful lesson.

242
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:08,687
Helping others makes our own lives
better and makes us better people.

243
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:11,890
So instead of just shooting pool
and drinking beer...

244
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:16,561
...let us Stonecutters use what we have
to help the less fortunate.

245
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:23,735
He's gone mad with power,
like that Albert Schweitzer guy.

246
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:36,014
Oh, for the love of God!

247
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,349
Somebody get the Jaws of Life!

248
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:44,189
Higher! Higher!

249
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,825
Oh, I'll give you higher,
my filthy little urchin.

250
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,433
You've won this round.

251
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,807
Oh, thank you, Mr. Simpson.

252
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:07,210
It looks so much better.

253
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:10,313
A beautiful sky blue.

254
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:16,986
You were right, Lisa.
I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled.

255
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:19,922
And with my brothers
the Stonecutters behind me...

256
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:23,860
...this is the beginning
of a better world for all of us.

257
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:26,229
- We gotta kill him!
- Take it easy, Moe.

258
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:31,264
Let's hear from the Stonecutter World
Council before we act too rashly.

259
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:32,799
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

260
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:35,268
- Kill the fool!
- Afraid I have to disagree...

261
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:40,041
...with Orville, Jack and Mister. Can't
we just do something to his voice box?

262
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:42,076
We might as well face the truth.

263
00:18:42,243 --> 00:18:45,981
As long as we're Stonecutters,
he will control our lives.

264
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:50,419
Maybe. But maybe we don't
wanna be Stonecutters no more.

265
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,363
This is much better than
the old Stonecutter hall.

266
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,701
Silence. I now call to order
the first meeting...

267
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,856
...of the ancient, mystic society of...

268
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:08,299
...No Homers.

269
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:13,030
Hey, fellas. Can I join?

270
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:16,319
Sorry. No Homers.

271
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,775
Loyal Stonecutters...

272
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:23,601
...let us begin our reenactment
of the Battle of Gettysburg.

273
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:29,675
Homer, you can't just keep hanging out
with these Colobus monkeys.

274
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:32,225
Somebody's gonna get parasites.

275
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:35,782
Oh, Marge, kids, I miss my club.

276
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,634
Oh, Homie.

277
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,829
You know, you are a member
of a very exclusive club.

278
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:46,722
- The Black Panthers?
- No, the family Simpson...

279
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:49,205
...which has just five members.

280
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:54,198
And only two of those members
have special rings.

281
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,547
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

282
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,097
I meant our wedding rings!

283
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,755
You know, Marge, you're right.

284
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:08,460
The Simpson family is the best
possible club I could belong to.

285
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:16,044
This club better be worth it.

286
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,097
All right, all right, it's Lisa's turn.

287
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:33,661
Who controls the British crown?
Who keeps the metric system down?

288
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:37,789
We do
We do

289
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:41,916
Who keeps Atlantis off the maps?
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

290
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:46,044
We do
We do

291
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,104
Who holds back the electric car?

292
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:54,232
Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?

293
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,359
We do
We do

294
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:02,419
Who robs cavefish of their sight?
Who rigs every Oscar night?

295
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,507
We do

296
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:09,433
We do

297
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:12,252
Shut up.
