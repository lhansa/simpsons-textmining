1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Bart vs. Australia

2
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:27,937
Go, toothpaste. Go!
Move your pasty, white butt!

3
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:30,420
Come on, shampoo!
You can do it!

4
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:33,071
I won your stupid
bathroom-products race!

5
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:35,856
No fair. You only won
because you had the inside track.

6
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:37,702
If the water had spun
the other way...

7
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:40,454
It never spins the other way.
In the Northern Hemisphere...

8
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,467
...water always drains
counter-clockwise.

9
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:44,179
It's called the Coriolis effect.

10
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:47,501
No way.
Water doesn't obey your rules.

11
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:50,185
It goes where it wants.
Like me, babe.

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,910
Yes, Bart.
Why don't you try it and see.

13
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:59,212
I know I've seen it go the other way.

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,729
Ah, faithful toilet.

15
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:03,742
You'll prove me right.

16
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:13,944
I'm singing in the show...

17
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:16,393
Hot! Cold!

18
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:20,487
Hot! Cold! Hot!
Who's doing that?

19
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:26,997
Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart,
use the plunger.

20
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:30,454
Bart, water will only go the other way
in the Southern Hemisphere.

21
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:33,272
What the hell
is the Southern Hemisphere?

22
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:35,353
Haven't you ever looked at your globe?

23
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:41,427
See? The Southern Hemisphere is made
up of everything below the equa...

24
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:45,319
This line.

25
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,011
So down there in, say, Argentina...

26
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:52,266
...or Rand McNally,
all their water runs backwards?

27
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:56,762
In fact, in Rand McNally,
they wear hats on their feet...

28
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,118
...and hamburgers eat people.
- Cool.

29
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:20,085
Hello, Southern Hemisphere?

30
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:22,299
Which way does the water go
in your toilet?

31
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,917
Just a minute, I'll check.

32
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:32,434
Nuts.

33
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:39,850
Please to repeat again, and I will
translating for the el presidente.

34
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:42,870
Which way does the water turn
in your toilet?

35
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:56,226
I can't get a straight answer
out of this crazy hemisphere.

36
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:05,923
- Nuisance phone.

37
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,917
Bart, you can't actually call
these places.

38
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:19,279
Don't you know how expensive
international calls are?

39
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,870
Hello, operator,
I'd like to make a collect call...

40
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:24,682
...to Australia.

41
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,689
This is the international operator.
Will you accept a collect call from...?

42
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:38,246
Yes, this is Dr. Bart Simpson of
the International Drainage Commission.

43
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,528
- It's an emergency.
- If it's an emergency...

44
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:43,213
We understand drains in your area
have malfunctioned...

45
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:46,803
...sucking in people and whatnot.
- Willikers! That's awful!

46
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:49,891
Indeed. We need you to check
your sinks and toilets...

47
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:54,555
...and tell us which way the water
is going. And please stand clear!

48
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:03,683
The fixtures, they're all
draining clockwise, sir.

49
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,300
She was right.
Stupid Lisa, science queen.

50
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:09,958
Well, why don't you just check
your neighbors' drains. I'll hold.

51
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,548
Hey, Bart, the bakery caught fire
and all of downtown smells like cookies.

52
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,991
Want to go smell?

53
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:23,347
Yes. Yes, I do.

54
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:33,112
Hello, sir? Sir?

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,240
I've returned from the Quilamaguery's
place. They're draining clockwise too.

56
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,454
Draining?
I don't care about that anymore.

57
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,032
Are we in any dang...

58
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:50,864
"Burkina Faso"? "Disputed Zone"?
Who called all these weird places?

59
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:52,877
Quiet, it might be you.
I can 't remember.

60
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:56,401
- No, I'm gonna ask Marge.
- No! No! Why embarrass us both?

61
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:59,488
Just write a check and I'll release
some more endorphins.

62
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:05,730
Nine hundred dollary-doos?! Tobias!

63
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:09,320
Did you accept a six-hour collect call
from the States?

64
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,763
It was an emergency call...

65
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:14,152
...from the International Drainage
Commission in Springfield.

66
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:17,374
Oh, my God! There's nothing wrong
with the bidet, is there?

67
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,964
- Hello?
- Right, I'm calling all the way...

68
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:22,877
...from Squatter's Crog, Australia.

69
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:27,206
And I want to speak
to Dr. Bart Simpson right now.

70
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,454
- Hold, please.
- All right, but I don't...

71
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,904
Hello. Burt Stanton speaking.

72
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:34,857
I said, Bart Simpson!
What kind of company is this?

73
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,300
Bart Simpson's office.

74
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,884
Thank the great, good Lord.
Look, I was just saying...

75
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,964
One moment, please.

76
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:45,428
Who do they think I am,
some stupid Aussie drongo?

77
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,139
Bleeding Yanks. I ought to...

78
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:50,293
This is Bart Simpson.
Can I help you, ma'am?

79
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:52,676
Yeah...
My name is Bruno Drundridge, right.

80
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:54,656
You owe me $900, mate!

81
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:58,213
- No, you owe me $900!
- All right, you...

82
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:01,266
You're just some punk kid, aren't you?

83
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:05,629
You picked the wrong guy
to tangle with here, mate.

84
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:08,951
I don't think so.
You're all the way in Australia.

85
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,609
Hey, I think I hear
a dingo eating your baby.

86
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:18,079
That's it! I'm gonna report this
to me member of Parliament.

87
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,756
Hey, Gus!

88
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:21,938
I got something to report to you!

89
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,622
That's a bloody outrage, it is!

90
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,683
I'm gonna take this all the way
to the prime minister!

91
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:34,119
Hey, Mr. Prime Minister!

92
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,562
Andy!

93
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:38,817
Aye, mates. What's the good word?

94
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:42,475
"Mr. Simpson," blah, blah.

95
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:44,824
"Misrepresentation over telephone..."

96
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,837
"Sincerely," some Australian jerk.

97
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,146
Hey, I need that!

98
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,193
"Office of the Solicitor General"?

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,206
"Office of the Prime Minister"?

100
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:06,099
"Hopping Mad Collection Agency"?
What is all this stuff?

101
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,293
Nothing. Some stupid country
thinks I owe them money.

102
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:13,381
Bart, you better talk
to Mom and Dad about this.

103
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,374
Hey, guys? Just so you don't hear
any wild rumors, I'm being indicted...

104
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:21,099
...for fraud in Australia.
- That's no reason to block the TV.

105
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,810
Oh, my.

106
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:29,092
Bart, did you trick an Australian boy
into accepting a $900 collect call?

107
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:30,669
Yes'm.

108
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,038
There it is, Australia. I'll be damned.

109
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,126
Look at this country.
"You-are-gay."

110
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:48,219
Oh, my. Hello. I'm Evan Conover
with the U.S. State Department.

111
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:53,991
"Undersecretary for International
Protocol, Brat and Punk Division."

112
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:57,615
Unfortunately, your little escapade
could not have come at a worse time.

113
00:07:57,817 --> 00:08:01,441
Americo-Australianian relations
are at an all-time low.

114
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:06,676
In the late 1980s, the U.S. Experienced
a short-lived infatuation...

115
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:09,327
...with Australian culture.

116
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,985
The Aussies thought
this would be permanent.

117
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,112
I know those words,
but that sign makes no sense.

118
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,266
Anyway, the down-under fad fizzled,
and the diplomatic climate...

119
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,381
...turned absolutely frosty.

120
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,105
Let's pretend we didn't see that.

121
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:30,334
And Bart's childish taunting
agitated the Aussies further.

122
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:34,897
Oh, he'll agitate you. He sure will.

123
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,475
- What can we do for you?
- It's too late...

124
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:42,985
...to pay back the money.

125
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,736
But as a sign of good faith
to our Australian friends...

126
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:48,052
...we'd like to imprison Bart
for five years.

127
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:51,139
That's tough but fair.
Boy, go with the man.

128
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:53,857
No, no, no!

129
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm not gonna have my son go to jail
over some silly tiff with Australia.

130
00:08:58,555 --> 00:09:02,313
You'll just have to find some
other country to have relations with.

131
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:05,334
You're sure, now?
The prison train is sailing.

132
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,488
Okay, I'm not hearing a lot
of support for prison.

133
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,535
There is one other option.

134
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:14,897
They'll drop the charges if Bart
makes a public apology in Australia.

135
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:18,219
All Bart has to do is apologize
and we get a free trip to Australia?

136
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,777
I can handle that.
I'm an expert at phony apologies.

137
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:23,354
- Bart!
- I'm sorry.

138
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,266
That's better.

139
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,266
We left at 1:30 p.m., Monday.
What time is it now?

140
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:02,515
It's 6:45 a.m., next Wednesday.

141
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:05,904
You may also be interested to know
that it's summer here, not winter.

142
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,105
What does that sign say? I thought
they spoke English in this country.

143
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:14,327
It says you can't bring in
outside plants or animals.

144
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:19,562
Any foreign creature you bring in
could upset the environmental balance.

145
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:24,662
Sorry, girl, I don't want to get in
any more trouble down here.

146
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:27,649
I'll pick you up on the way home.

147
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,240
Hey, are you, like, one
of those English guards...

148
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:49,092
...who can't laugh or smile
or anything?

149
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:56,407
No, sir! U.S. Marine Corps, sir!

150
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,709
Oh, yeah. This is the life.

151
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,300
Boy, next summer can you commit
some fraud in Orlando, Florida?

152
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:07,246
I'm way ahead of you, Dad.

153
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:10,501
Knock. Simpsons, I'd like you
to meet our ambassador...

154
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,280
...the Honorable Averil Ward.

155
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:15,803
Hello. Now, everything is all set
for Bart's apology.

156
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,756
Mr. Conover will meet you
at the Parliament House at 3 p.m.

157
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:20,166
Any questions?

158
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,481
- Do the toilets go backwards in here?
- No.

159
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,233
To combat homesickness,
we have a device that makes...

160
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,246
...them swirl the correct American way.

161
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:36,508
Sweet land of liberty

162
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,763
Of thee I sing

163
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:47,179
Hey, GI Joe, your sign's broken.
We're already in Australia.

164
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:50,334
Actually, sir, the embassy is considered
American soil, sir.

165
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,454
Really? Look, boy.
Now I'm in Australia.

166
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:56,105
Now I'm in America.
Australia. America.

167
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:58,119
- Australia.
- I get it, Dad.

168
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,703
Homer, that's enough.

169
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:04,226
Here in America,
we don't tolerate that crap, sir.

170
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:11,407
"Australia was founded as a
settlement for British convicts."

171
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:13,354
Lisa, watch your camera.

172
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,307
You call that a knife?

173
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:23,891
This is a knife.

174
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:27,716
- That's not a knife. That's a spoon.
- All right, all right. You win.

175
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:30,770
I see you've played
knifie-spoonie before.

176
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:37,515
Hey, give me one of those famous
giant beers I've heard so much about.

177
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,092
Something wrong, Yank?

178
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,381
No. It's pretty big, I guess.

179
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:45,602
- I'll just have a cup of coffee.
- Beer it is.

180
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,280
No, I said, coffee.

181
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:50,233
- Beer?
- Coffee.

182
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,944
Beer?

183
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:56,038
- C-O...
- B-E...

184
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:04,193
We'll meet you boys back here
for dinner. Good luck, honey.

185
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:08,219
Bart, I'm sorry I'm gonna miss
your public humiliation.

186
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:12,515
But the Walambaloo Dirt Monument
is just too exciting to pass up.

187
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:24,519
Hear ye! Hear ye!
This session will now come to order.

188
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:27,405
With the cooperation
of the U.S. Department of State...

189
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,619
...we have present today
one Bart Simpson.

190
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:34,989
I believe he has something to say.

191
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,834
Bart?

192
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,995
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:49,217
I'm sorry for what I did
to your country.

194
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:54,015
Well, you're free to go, Bart...

195
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:55,660
...right after your
additional punishment.

196
00:13:57,774 --> 00:14:00,458
- Punishment!
- A mere apology would be a bit empty.

197
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,472
Let the booting begin!

198
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:05,324
- Booting?
- It's just a little kick in the bum.

199
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:20,670
What kind of a sick country would
kick someone with a giant boot?

200
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:24,227
Mr. Simpson, shush. Disparaging
the boot is a bootable offense.

201
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:26,643
It's one of their proudest traditions.

202
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:34,563
You sold us out, Conover!

203
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:45,972
Stand back or I'll boot
your prime minister! I'll do it.

204
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,623
So help me God, I'll boot him!

205
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:51,442
When will you Australians learn?

206
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,294
In America,
we stopped using corporal punishment.

207
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,147
And things have never been better.
The streets are safe...

208
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,402
...old people strut confidently through
the darkest alleys...

209
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:04,697
...and the weak and nerdy are admired
for their computer-programming abilities.

210
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:08,791
So like us,
let your children run wild and free...

211
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:11,543
...because, as the old saying goes:

212
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,167
"Let your children run wild and free."

213
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:20,536
Now, boy, run back to the embassy!
Back to American soil!

214
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,637
I'll stop them.

215
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:30,637
Oh, no, it's coming back this way.

216
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:34,127
That throwing stick stunt of yours
has boomeranged on us.

217
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:40,267
Hey, we can get away
in their pouches.

218
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,596
It's not like in cartoons.

219
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:47,247
Yeah. There's a lot more mucus.

220
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:54,059
Mom, you said I could
have one souvenir, right?

221
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,469
Well, I want a didjeridu.

222
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:04,831
That seems very noisy and expensive
for a souvenir.

223
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:08,724
Why don't you get this nice cap.
It's clever, just like you.

224
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:16,811
Get out! Get out! Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here!

225
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:20,402
These bloody things are everywhere.
They're in the lift, the lorry...

226
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:23,053
...in the bon whizzer,
and the Malonga Gilderchuck.

227
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:27,180
They're like kangaroos.
But they're reptiles, they is.

228
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,764
We have them in America.
They're called bullfrogs.

229
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:31,878
What? That's an odd name.

230
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:34,261
I'd have called them chazwazzers.

231
00:16:36,308 --> 00:16:38,623
Lisa!

232
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:40,569
Marge!

233
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:50,603
The Simpsons.

234
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,153
Well, they're not getting back in here.

235
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:10,698
I can't believe our government
would set up Bart like that.

236
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:13,584
I'm very angry
at the State Department right now.

237
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:17,476
Yes, but... Please, we're about to reach
a breakthrough with the Aussies.

238
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:21,268
Then it's agreed. During the bargaining
session, we each get two candy apples.

239
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:23,516
All right, one candy and one caramel.

240
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:25,698
Oh, for the love of criminy!
Give me that!

241
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:28,483
I know Bart did something wrong.
But he's my son...

242
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:31,100
...and I'm going to punish him myself.

243
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:33,416
Our countries
may have their differences...

244
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:36,704
...but as human beings,
I think we can all agree...

245
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:41,570
...there's no substitute for the discipline
of a loving parent.

246
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:44,053
He wants to talk to you.

247
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:46,100
Hello.

248
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:47,678
So we're in agreement.

249
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:50,027
She won't be allowed
near the phone again.

250
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:52,443
We did it.

251
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:56,100
We've worked out a compromise
that will allow both nations to save face.

252
00:17:56,302 --> 00:17:57,745
We've argued them down to...

253
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,154
...a booting.
- What?

254
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:02,812
The prime minister just wants
to kick you once through the gate...

255
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,664
...with a regular shoe.
- I believe it's a wingtip.

256
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,751
No deal.
This is my son we're talking about.

257
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,006
Sure, he's not perfect,
but who is in this workaday world?

258
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,423
No. Mom, wait.

259
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,631
It's time for me to bend over
and receive my destiny.

260
00:18:30,228 --> 00:18:34,859
Thank you, Bart. I promise
I won't make fun of you later for this.

261
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,946
Show them what American butts
are made of, son.

262
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:43,718
That's it, lad.

263
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:47,074
This is for the
Commonwealth of Australia.

264
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:56,067
And this is
for the United States of America.

265
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:14,288
I'm glad you're okay, honey.

266
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:17,208
But I wish you'd chosen a more
tasteful way to be patriotic.

267
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:20,731
I'm impressed you were able
to write so legibly on your own butt.

268
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:34,758
All right, mates, let them have it!

269
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:40,429
Hey, do we get to land
on an aircraft carrier?

270
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,818
No, sir. The closest vessel
is the USS Walter Mondale.

271
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:46,805
It's a laundry ship.
They'll take you the rest of the way.

272
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:03,684
Hey, look.
Those frogs are eating all their crops.

273
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,503
Well, that's what happens
when you introduce foreign species...

274
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:14,355
...into an ecosystem
that can't handle them.
