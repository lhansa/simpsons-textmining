2
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,199
D'oh!

3
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,780
Welcome to the Magic Palace.

4
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:34,485
- Okay. You can park my car. But no joyriding!
- Mmm.

5
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,757
Wait a minute.

6
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,496
Hello, I'm Questo. I'll be your waiter
and mentalist for this evening.

7
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,669
I'm receiving a drink order.
Something foamy. Is it a "B"-

8
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,340
Beer, yes! How did you know?
Hmm? Ahh.

9
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:01,978
And for the lady,
a Long Island Iced Tea.

10
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,488
Wow.

11
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:09,221
Oh, they oughta call that
a"Large" Island Iced Tea.

12
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,792
- No, "Long" is better.
- Are you really gonna drink that?

13
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,531
Well, maybe a sip.
I don't want to offend our mentalist.

14
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,199
If she doesn't like it, I'll just die!

15
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,606
Mmm.

16
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,605
Mmm!

17
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,310
Mom, you're missing a great show.

18
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,285
You don't know what I'm missin'.

19
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:43,824
Mmm! I'd like to visit that Long Island place,
if only it were real.

20
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,763
Now for my next illusion,
I'll need a volunteer.

21
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,734
I'll do it!
I always end up doing it.

22
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,366
- Hi.
- I'm Diablo. What's your name?

23
00:02:55,475 --> 00:03:00,071
- Marge.
- Okay, Marge. And who's
that gentleman you're with?

24
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,638
That's no gentleman.
That's my husband.

25
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:10,546
- Wow. Mom got a laugh.
- I wish she drank every day.

26
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,423
Do we love Marge or what?

27
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,496
Oh, please.
I didn't say that for clapping.

28
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,225
- Now, Marge, I have a problem.
- Oh, yeah?

29
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,359
You see, the emperor of China's coming over
and I don't have enough colorful silks.

30
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,369
- Oh.
- So what I need of you is-

31
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:30,135
You talk too much.
Abraca-blab-ra. Am I right?

32
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,303
See, the ladies know what I'm talking about.

33
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:38,043
Ha. Ha. Tell you what?
Let's get this ball gag on ya.

34
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:43,214
There we go.
And we'll skip right ahead to the Kill-O-Tine.

35
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,757
Whoa, baby!

36
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,556
Don't worry, Marge.
You won't feel a thing.

37
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,563
You'll feel four things.

38
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,828
He's very good.

39
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,740
So she was made of chimps.

40
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,372
Man, magic can do anything!

41
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,383
What happened to Mom?

42
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,080
<i>I'm right here!</i>

43
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,724
No! No! Get off of me!

44
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,761
<i>Folks, this is not</i>
<i>part of the act. Please help her.</i>

45
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,922
No! Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off! Get 'em off!

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,265
Cool gift shop.
"Ages eight to 80."

47
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,498
Huh. That's me!
Dad, will you get me this magic kit?

48
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:38,202
Gee, I wish I could, Son.
But we already left the gift shop.

49
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,508
D'oh!

50
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,380
Wow. It's approved by
the Royal Magic College of Hyderabad.

51
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,784
- That's a party magic college.
- It is not.

52
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,014
- Yah-huh.
- Nuh-huh.

53
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,387
- Yah-huh.
- Would you cut it out, you two?

54
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,325
Mommy needs
some quiet right now.

55
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,625
What the hell is that?

56
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,031
It looks like a sturgeon.

57
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,502
But where did it come from?

58
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:24,051
Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm.
Well, there's your problem.

59
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,785
I know that.
How much to fix it?

60
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,555
Oh. Well, that's a foreign fish
we're looking at.

61
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,153
So, uh, 6,500.

62
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,063
- Plus 350.
- Oh, I can't afford that.

63
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,229
Maybe I can make some money, Dad.
The magic act is really coming along.

64
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,605
He couldn't breathe.

65
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,941
<i>Step right up!</i>
<i>See the magic boy!</i>

66
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,709
Witness mystifying feats that
will leave you scratching your head...

67
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,842
until it's raw and bloody!

68
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,479
- Mmm. Look.
- Oh, my goodness!

69
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,786
Come on. Pony up, Flanders.
The kid's not turning tricks for nothin'.

70
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,885
- Oh, no. I could never support the black arts.
- Black arts?

71
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,863
Yeah, you know: Magic,
fortune telling, Oriental cooking.

72
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,491
Hey, you guys!

73
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,502
You're in our spot.

74
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,971
What? Oh, okay, we'll move.
We don't want any trouble, fellas.

75
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,974
Dad, only one of them is real.

76
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,271
- I know, but which one?
- Ohh.

77
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,048
Sixty cents? I would have made more
if I had gone into work today!

78
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,086
Hey, don't blame me.
I gotta compete with TV and the Internet.

79
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,883
A good son would come
through for his dad.

80
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,458
Yeah. And a good dad wouldn't miss
his son's little league games.

81
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,995
I told you!
Lfind them boring!

82
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,963
Well, I showed up for all
your stupid interventions!

83
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,001
Oh, that's it!
You can walk home!

84
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,076
Dad, come back! Ohh.

85
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,236
I can't walk home
with all this stuff.

86
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:59,080
- Ohh.
- Poor boy. Here's some money for bus fare.

87
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:03,281
- My father was a monster too.
- Hmm.

88
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,954
Come on, brothers.
Dig deep.

89
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:15,066
Stupid non-magical son
can't pay to fix my car.

90
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,331
- Hey, Homer! Check it out!
- What the-

91
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,601
Is that a steak?

92
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,143
- Yeah. I know a little place.
- Who gave you all this money?

93
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,179
Mmm, people. I guess they
thought I was a charity case.

94
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,181
Really?

95
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,047
Hey, maybe we could do that again.

96
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,713
Can you look even more pathetic?

97
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:41,021
Oh, that's beautiful!
We could make a fortune!

98
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,255
But wouldn't that
make us con artists?

99
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,297
Well, yeah.

100
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,495
But God conned me out of
6,500 bucks in car repairs.

101
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:55,870
So, in a way, we'd just be
balancing out the universe.

102
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,344
There you go!
We'd be stealing from people we know.

103
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,505
It's just like the seasons.

104
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,175
Sounds good.
You want to eat my fat?

105
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,050
I think you know the answer to that.

106
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,616
This book has all the classic cons.

107
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,992
There's the Pigeon Drop,
the Ear Wigger, the Brillstein grab-

108
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,088
Do they have any
father-and-son grifts?

109
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,464
- Well, there's the Albany Ham Scam.
- <i>Interesting.</i>

110
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,730
Oh, wait.
Here we go.

111
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:33,175
- Oh.
- What are you doing? Why are you
frosting that old throw pillow?

112
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,213
I could ask you
the very same question.

113
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,283
Uh, should I just
back out of the room?

114
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:42,787
Would you?

115
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,783
Okay, Dad, ready for our first con?

116
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,828
You bet.
Let's trim the mark.

117
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,897
Nice use of the lingo, Homer.

118
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,161
- 10-4, kemosabe.
- Ohh.

119
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,597
I love you too.

120
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,608
Good night and have
a pleasant tomorrow.

121
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,645
- Oh!
- Oh, excuse me.

122
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,647
What happened?
Where's my cake?

123
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,240
- It's all right, isn't it?
- Uh-

124
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,717
What have you done,
you clumsy little ox?

125
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,220
That cake was for your deaf sister!

126
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,554
- Sir, it was my fault.
- No, no. Don't protect him.

127
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,060
You'll work off that cake
in the acid mines!

128
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,062
No! No, no!
I'll pay for the cake.

129
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,133
Well, you're the mark... of integrity.

130
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,276
Wow! Look at all this loot!
What should we buy first?

131
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,343
A singing rubber fish, of course.

132
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,412
There you are.
How was the magic act?

133
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,140
What in the hell
are you talking about?

134
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,944
Oh, right. The magic.

135
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,350
The magic was great!
It's really the way to go.

136
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,218
How'd you do your act?
You left your magic kit here.

137
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,690
Or so it would seem.

138
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,818
Suckers.

139
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,260
I don't know, Mom.
I think they're up to something.

140
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,389
Oh, it sure looks that way.

141
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,627
But at least Bart and Homer
are spending quality time together.

142
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,034
Is that a Long Island Iced Tea?

143
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,938
Oh, this? Hmm.
I think it is.

144
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,073
Mmm. You're a pretty girl.

145
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,276
Here, boy!
Here, doggie!

146
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,321
- Oh, where has my little dog gone?
- Oh, you lost your doggie?

147
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,914
Yeah. I saw him playing in the water,
and then he was gone.

148
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,426
He had a bright red leash
with bells on it.

149
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,519
Oh, I'm sure he's around here
somewhere.

150
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, dear Lord.

151
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:41,768
He's the bestest dog ever. He's light brown
and he has a spot on him shaped like a heart.

152
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,275
- Sorry, son. But-
- I just gotta get him back!

153
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,506
Or if not him,
a similar dog.

154
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,582
Dog for sale!

155
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,652
Dog for sale!

156
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,745
- How much for the dog?
- Oh, he's not for sale.

157
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:01,884
- Oh, well.
- Although, if the right offer came along-

158
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,229
Here's for the repairs
and a little extra for you.

159
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,235
Hey. Thanks, chief.

160
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,238
Uhh! My bar mitzvah cake!

161
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,808
Oy! I'll never be a man.

162
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,877
Uhh.

163
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,707
- Dad?
- Yeah, Son?

164
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,216
Why are we still grifting? The car's paid for.
Doesn't that balance out the universe?

165
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,047
In a way. But I also remembered
some other stuff.

166
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,486
Like my bike that
was stolen in third grade.

167
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,080
- Plus the baldness.
- Okay. I'm sold.

168
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,387
Hello.
Is the lady of the house in?

169
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:41,364
Oh, no! Homer, remember?
Maudie got called up to heaven.

170
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:46,063
- Oh. Of course. Of course. It's just that-
- What?

171
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,131
Well, before she died, she ordered
this Bible especially for you.

172
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,268
Why, there's my name, in gold.

173
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,213
Now you weren't home,
so we had to pay the delivery man.

174
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,045
Well, I'll just reimburse you right-

175
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:04,088
Wait a minute. This seems an awful lot
like that movie <i>Paper Moon.</i>

176
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,251
- Run, Dad!
- Okay!

177
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,920
- We'll be safe in here.
- That was too close.

178
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,930
- Maybe it's time to quit the game.
- <i>Amateurs!</i>

179
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,932
- Huh?
- Dad?

180
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,867
That's right.

181
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,237
- You don't smoke a pipe.
- That's right.

182
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,072
- How'd you get wise to us?
- Are you kiddin'?

183
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,840
They used to call me Grifty McGrift.

184
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,075
I wrote the book on flimflammin'.

185
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,845
Wow! He did!

186
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,912
Yeah. In the Depression, you had to grift.
Either that or work.

187
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,015
- So what's the pitch, old man?
- Team up with me, boys...

188
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,563
and we'll go for the biggest
honey pot of'em all!

189
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,500
Oh, my God!

190
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,163
I don't know.
Fleecin' old people?

191
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,834
Oh, why not? If we don't take their money,
they'll just give it to some televangelist.

192
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,912
Let's dust a few fossils.

193
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:06,918
Now this scam was in <i>The Sting, Part Two,</i>
so nobody knows about it.

194
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,987
Now as I recall, Jackie Gleason-

195
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,761
- Which one of you youngsters is Abe Simpson?
- I'm Abe Simpson.

196
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:21,993
You've just won $10 million
from that publisher's "cleary-dealie"!

197
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,868
- What?
- Everybody, come quick! Abe Simpson is rich!

198
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,872
I can't believe it!

199
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:33,240
I can finally afford
a young, crazy, stripper wife.

200
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:38,647
Yeah. I'm gonna get me the craziest, "strippiest"-

201
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,982
He's dead.

202
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,491
Oh, this is terrible.
Now who do we give the money to?

203
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,119
I guess we'll just have to haul
the check back to headquarters.

204
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,664
Too bad we couldn't just give it
to these nice folks.

205
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,862
Forget it, Ed. Do you know what
it costs to sign over a check this big?

206
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,599
Why, the wealth transfer fee would run
at least a hundred dollars a head.

207
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,005
You're right. We better just
take this check back for shredding.

208
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:08,273
No, wait. We got a hundred bucks each.
Hang on.

209
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,918
Thank you.
No shoving.

210
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,547
That's right. Put your money in here.
All of it. Is that everyone?

211
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,650
What's your problem, sport?
Afraid to be rich?

212
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,925
Hold your horses.
I'll get to ya!

213
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,001
F.B.I. You're under arrest for fraud.

214
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,472
Mm-hmm.

215
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,407
Throw the book at him, sonny.
D'oh!

216
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,445
Now, where's the inside man?

217
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,447
Mmm?

218
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,576
Call me mint jelly,
'cause I'm on the lam! Ahh!

219
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,084
So we're under arrest for fraud?

220
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,821
Yes, fraud.

221
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,971
Well, this is about the flashiest car
I've ever impounded.

222
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,871
Thanks. Whew!
It took a lot of grifting. Ooh!

223
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:14,241
Please, F.B.I. Man, don't throw us in jail.
We just made one mistake.

224
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,282
Yeah. We're not criminals.
We're just two crazy, mixed-up kids.

225
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,419
Mmm. Okay, tell you what.

226
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,718
I'll let you turn yourselves in.
Maybe they'll go easier on you.

227
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,783
- You'd do that for us?
- Well, I did ruin the boy's birthday cake.

228
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,056
Go on in.
But I'll be watching!

229
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,156
Okay. Thank you, sir.

230
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,735
Don't worry, Son.
I have an idea.

231
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,431
Chief, I'd like to
scare my son straight.

232
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,804
Could I show him a jail cell?

233
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,437
Oh, sure. I'll put you in the RickJames suite.
It's super freaky.

234
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,614
Okay, we're all locked up now.

235
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,053
Yeah. You big idiot.

236
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:02,423
- Excellent. I guess I'll just be swiping your car now.
- What?

237
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,089
Oh, and this lovely bag of cash.

238
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,133
So long, suckers!
Woo-hoo!

239
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:16,340
- That's not an F.B.I. Badge.
- "Colgate Cavity Patrol"? Ohh!

240
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,536
- That guy was a grifter.
- Yeah. He conned us good.

241
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,443
Well, at least we still have our jobs
at the sweepstakes place.

242
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,845
- Ohh!
- What?

243
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,849
Mom's gonna wonder
where the car went.

244
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:30,479
- We better have a good story.
- Well, lies got us into this mess, Son.

245
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,955
From now on,
it's honesty all the way.

246
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,425
You were carjacked
in the church parking lot?

247
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:41,727
Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer
when- Bart, would you call him a crazy man?

248
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,530
Definitely.
Well, crazy about carjacking.

249
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:48,128
- What did he look like?
- Uh, mmm, let's see.

250
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,641
He was foreign, and he had-

251
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,202
- Wild, bushy hair, like an animal.
- Anything else?

252
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,772
Uh, well, he seemed like a loner.
Kept to himself mostly.

253
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,682
And he said if we went to the cops,
he'd come back for Maggie.

254
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,654
Oh, dear! We don't want that!

255
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,921
Anyhoo, the whole nightmare's
really made us sleepy.

256
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,996
Let's hit the hay.

257
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,631
Homie! Homie, wake up!

258
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:18,191
- They've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!
- Huh?

259
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:23,002
- But that's impossible.
- They're arresting him right now.

260
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,509
- I did not do it, I tell ya!
- Uh-oh.

261
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,412
At least, let me comb me hair.
It's all wild and bushy.

262
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,416
What do you care, Loner.

263
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,147
Well, look at that.
But who called the police?

264
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,554
- We did.
- After we got Maggie to a safe house, of course.

265
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,287
Hmm.
She hasn't touched her Manwich.

266
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,590
You cannot do this to Willie!

267
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,631
I'm innocent, I tell ya!

268
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,032
They always say they're innocent.
It's such a turnoff.

269
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,263
Dad, Willie got arrested 'cause of us!

270
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:57,308
Of course he did, Son. He's a filthy crook.
Now let's all hit the hay.

271
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,309
It's 10:00 in the morning.

272
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,175
I guess you haven't
heard of chloroform.

273
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:11,355
Will you tell the court your whereabouts
at the time of the carjacking?

274
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,925
I was alone in me
Unabomber-style shack.

275
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,221
I had nothing to do
with that carjacking.

276
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:20,856
Carjacking? Who said anything
about a carjacking?

277
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,332
But didn't ya just say-

278
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,632
- I'll ask the questions here, Carjacker Willie!
- Objection!

279
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,935
I'm gonna allow it. It characterizes
the defendant as a carjacker.

280
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:34,570
- Dad, we've gotta tell everyone the truth.
- Let's see how this plays out.

281
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,049
Mr. Simpson, could you
describe your assailant to the court?

282
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:43,417
I told you my memory is fuzzy. Fuzzy!

283
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,821
Fuzzy like Willie's beard?

284
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:51,794
Yes! Exactly! No, no. I mean
the whole incident is hazy.

285
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,162
Hazy like the moors of Scotland?

286
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,395
Yes, exactly!

287
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,665
Ohh!

288
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,441
Hey! Mountain Dew? Ohh!

289
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,276
Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

290
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:18,880
I believe
we was promised $5.00 a day.

291
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,552
All right then. Guilty!

292
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,620
<i>Carjacker Willie, I sentence you</i>
<i>to 10 years in prison!</i>

293
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,234
- Dad, tell them!
- When the time is right.

294
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,931
Ten years?
But I "didna" do it!

295
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,840
- Sure you "didna." Now let's get you to Attica-
- No!

296
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,009
You'll never send me up the river!

297
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,414
- Dad.
- Let's see where he's going with this.

298
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,718
Willie, as your employer, I insist-

299
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,758
Oh!

300
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,954
Stop! This has gone on
just long enough!

301
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,963
Nobody carjacked me.

302
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,193
I tried to pull a con
and got conned myself.

303
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,271
And then I lied to you all.

304
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,070
So did Bart.

305
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,910
Okay, players, that's a wrap!

306
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,685
Huh?

307
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:26,247
- Nice work, everybody.
- Wait a minute. This whole thing was a setup?

308
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,259
But Skinner got shot. Aah!

309
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,625
Yup. Blanks and a blood pack.

310
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,188
- Hey, watch it!
- I look like cable TV.

311
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,995
What about that bullet hole
in your hair?

312
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,366
Squibs.

313
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,271
Yeah, we hornswoggled you good.

314
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,275
But what about the guy
who took my car?

315
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,873
Devon Bradley. Character actor,
dancer, singer. I'm a triple threat!

316
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,248
He's doing <i>Dreamcoat</i>
at the dinner theater.

317
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,322
- I can't believe everyone was in on it.
- Willie wasn't!

318
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,831
Wait a minute. You're telling me
the police force, the TV news...

319
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,866
a courthouse full of people,
and a popular entertainer...

320
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,867
had nothing better to do than
to teach me and Bart a lesson?

321
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,904
I know it seems far-fetched,
even insulting to your intelligence.

322
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,941
But there's a simple and highly
satisfying explanation. You see-

323
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,272
Hey, everybody!
Surf s up!

324
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,076
- Cowabunga!
- Woo!

325
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,084
Uh! Uh!

326
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,453
Hey!

327
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,458
