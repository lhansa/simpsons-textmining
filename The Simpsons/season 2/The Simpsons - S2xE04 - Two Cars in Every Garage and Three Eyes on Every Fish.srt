1
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:07,409
Two Cars in Every Garage,
Three Eyes On Every Fish

2
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:43,369
-So, kids, caught anything?
-Not yet, sir.

3
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:47,209
-What do you use for bait?
-My brother's using worms...

4
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,685
...but I feel tranquility outweighs
catching fish and use nothing.

5
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:56,927
-I see. What's your name?
-Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?

6
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:00,921
I'm Dave Shutton. I'm a reporter
who's on the road a lot.

7
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:03,971
In my day, we didn't talk
that way to elders.

8
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,687
Well, this is my day, and we do, sir.

9
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,768
All right! We eat tonight!

10
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,766
Wait a minute.

11
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:17,450
One. Two. Three.

12
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:34,364
Leave it to old Mary Bailey...

13
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:38,082
...to finally do something
about that hideous mutation.

14
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:40,448
Mary Bailey! If I was governor...

15
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:43,411
-...I'd find better things to do.
-Such as?

16
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:48,323
Getting Washington and Lincoln's
birthdays as separate holidays.

17
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:53,169
President's Day! What a rip-off!
I bust my butt day in and--

18
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,927
-You're late.
-Someone will punch in for me.

19
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,725
Don't spill anything.

20
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:59,770
-Keep the mutants coming!
-I'll mutant you.

21
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:06,889
Oh, man! Plain cake donuts.

22
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,965
Thanks for taking
all the fancies, guys!

23
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,363
Why can't I ever get here on time?

24
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,047
Hi-ho, faceless employees.

25
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:19,883
In a few moments, the government
inspection team will be here...

26
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:23,443
...so look busy and keep quiet!
That's all.

27
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:26,252
Very stirring, sir.
Here they come.

28
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:28,369
Hold me, Smithers.

29
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:33,765
Okay. Geiger counters on.

30
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:39,446
That's normal background radiation.

31
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,571
You'd find it in
any nuclear facility...

32
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:46,043
-...or for that matter, hospitals.
-Sorry.

33
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,687
Gum used to seal crack
in cooling tower.

34
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:51,525
I'm as shocked as you.

35
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:56,164
-Plutonium rod used as paperweight.
-Now that shouldn't be.

36
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:02,011
Yeah, well, that's always
been like that.

37
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,327
-Just resting my eyes!
-Well done.

38
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:09,132
A rested employee
is a vigilant employee.

39
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,284
Monitoring station unmanned.

40
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:17,283
Look here, inspector, could I speak
to you privately in my office?

41
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:23,285
Mr. Burns, in 20 years, I have never
seen such a shoddy, deplorable--

42
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:28,049
Oh, look! Some careless person
has left thousands of dollars...

43
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:32,570
...just lying here on my table.
Smithers, why don't we leave...

44
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:38,205
...and hopefully, when we return,
the pile of money will be gone.

45
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:44,365
The money and a
stupid man are still here.

46
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:48,924
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were trying to bribe me.

47
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:54,002
Is there some confusion about this?
Take it! Take it, you poor schmo!

48
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:57,603
Mr. Burns!
I'm gonna overlook this felony.

49
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:03,809
However, I will not overlook the 342
violations I have observed today.

50
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:09,371
Either bring this place up to code,
or we'll shut it down. Good day.

51
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:15,846
Oh, well. A little dab of paint
here, a little spackle there.

52
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:19,449
How much could it possibly cost
to fix this place up?

53
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:22,332
-Approximately $56 million.
-56 million?!

54
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:26,168
-Don't hit me, sir.
-Oh, that I had the strength to.

55
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:30,412
Now please go. I would be alone.

56
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,647
Empty.

57
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,368
Just resting my eyes!

58
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,162
Holy moly! 9:30.

59
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:21,491
Hi, Marge. Sorry I didn't call,
but it's been a madhouse here!

60
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:25,129
Yeah, these 12-hour
days are killing me.

61
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,572
Echo!

62
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:57,722
Mr. Burns?

63
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,402
Sorry, sir.
It's me, Homer Simpson.

64
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:04,407
-Is everything all right?
-Working late, Simpson?

65
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:08,848
-Yes, sir.
-You and I are a dying breed.

66
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:11,846
I'll share something with you.
Hop in.

67
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,327
Cushy!

68
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:20,408
They're trying to shut us down. They
say we're contaminating the planet.

69
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:24,891
-Well, nobody's perfect.
-Can't they just get off our backs?

70
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:28,563
If I was governor,
I'd do things a lot differently.

71
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,765
You know how much
it costs to run for office?

72
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:35,721
-More than any honest man can afford!
-I bet you could.

73
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:39,243
Don't get me wrong.
You're an honest man.

74
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:42,485
I just meant you could afford
to run for governor.

75
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:47,283
I'm just rambling because you keep
staring at me, but it's true.

76
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:50,604
If you were governor,
you could decide what's safe.

77
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:55,563
-Where are we going, sir?
-To create a new and better world.

78
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,248
If it's on the way,
could you drop me at my house?

79
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:07,041
-He's got my vote.
-Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.

80
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:11,729
Mary Bailey won't fire me if I don't
vote for her. I'm for Burns!

81
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:15,602
A political discussion at our table.
I feel like a Kennedy!

82
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:20,682
I don't see how that despicable man
has a chance against Mary Bailey...

83
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:23,845
...our state's most beloved governor.

84
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,607
Now, here's the problem as I see it.

85
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,207
While Bailey is beloved by all...

86
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:33,286
...98 percent of the voters
rate you as despicable or worse.

87
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:36,690
So we got the finest campaign team
money can buy.

88
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:40,522
This is your speech writer,
joke writer, spin doctor...

89
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:42,843
...makeup man and personal trainer.

90
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:47,205
Their job: to turn this Mr. Burns,
into this.

91
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:49,648
Why are my teeth showing like that?

92
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:53,362
-Because you're smiling!
-Excellent!

93
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,525
This is the kind of trickery
I'm paying you for.

94
00:08:56,693 --> 00:09:00,129
How do we turn Joe Six-pack
against Mary Bailey?

95
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:04,684
With this team.
Your muckraker, character assassin...

96
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,287
-...mudslinger, garbologist.
-Hello.

97
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:13,125
Their job is to turn Mary Bailey
from this, into this.

98
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,528
Visual aids help so much. Thanks.

99
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:20,164
But first there's a burning issue that
we need to neutralize.

100
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:23,690
I hate that fish!

101
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:27,368
Thank you for watching
Movie for a Dreary Afternoon.

102
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,890
Next, a political announcement
from the friends of Montgomery Burns.

103
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:34,169
-Burns? Change it.
-You do it.

104
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,806
I did it last week.

105
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:39,522
Fine. Be a jerk.
We'll just sit here and watch it.

106
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:44,932
Oh, no! An election? That's when
they close the bars, isn't it?

107
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:46,321
Sorry, Barney.

108
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,331
I wonder if he'll
talk about that fish.

109
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:54,123
Oh, Marge. I bet before the papers
blew this out of proportion...

110
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,524
...you didn't even know
how many eyes a fish had.

111
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:00,452
-Thirty seconds.
-Remember to smile.

112
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:04,128
-I am smiling.
-You'll have to do better than that.

113
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:07,243
-How's this?
-There you go!

114
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:10,883
-I'll be sore tomorrow.
-We've done all we can.

115
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,964
-The rest is up to you.
-Don't worry.

116
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,243
When this announcement's done...

117
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:20,288
...every Johnny Lunch-pail in this
state will be eating out of my hand.

118
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:24,372
Hello, friends. I'm Montgomery
Burns, your next governor.

119
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,048
I'm here to talk to you
about my little friend Blinky.

120
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:31,492
Many of you think he's a
a hideous mutation.

121
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:35,248
That simply isn't true.
Don't take my word for it.

122
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:38,689
Let's ask an actor portraying
Charles Darwin.

123
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:41,242
-Hello.
-Hello, Charles.

124
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:44,689
Tell them about
your theory of natural selection.

125
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:49,529
Glad to. Every so often, Mother
Nature changes her animals...

126
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:53,368
...giving them bigger teeth,
sharper claws, longer legs...

127
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,524
...or in this case, a third eye.

128
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,207
If these changes
are an improvement...

129
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:02,844
...the new animals thrive and multiply
and spread across the earth.

130
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:06,528
So this fish might
have an advantage over other fish.

131
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:08,843
It may be a kind of super-fish.

132
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:11,891
I wouldn't mind a third eye,
would you?

133
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:13,884
No. You see, friends...

134
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:17,728
...if our antinuclear naysayers
and choose-upsiders...

135
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:21,488
...came upon an elephant
next to our power plant...

136
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:26,329
...they'd probably blame his ridiculous
nose on the nuclear bogeyman.

137
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:32,045
This fish is a miracle of nature,
with a taste that can't be beat.

138
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:38,049
So say what you want about me,
I can take the slings and arrows.

139
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:44,686
But stop slandering poor, defenseless
Blinky. Good night and God bless.

140
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:51,642
Only a moron wouldn't cast his vote
For Monty Burns

141
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,691
Wow! Super-fish!

142
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:56,606
I wish the government
would get off his back.

143
00:11:56,813 --> 00:12:01,443
That Burns is just what this state
needs, young blood!

144
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:04,213
I hope we can count
on your support.

145
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:09,567
-Homer, I'm a Bailey booster.
-Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns booster.

146
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:14,085
Congratulations, Mr. Burns,
the polls show you're up six points.

147
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:17,450
-Giving me a total of?
-Six. We're on our way.

148
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:23,889
My worthy opponent seems to think
that the voters are gullible fools.

149
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:27,682
I'll rely on their intelligence
and good judgment.

150
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,445
Interesting. Good luck.

151
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:31,723
And I say taxes are too high!

152
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:59,041
Have you found any dirt
on Mary Bailey?

153
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,647
-We went through her trash.
-Talked to her maid.

154
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:05,567
The only dirt we've got
is from a guy who dated her at 16.

155
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,803
-And?
-He felt her up.

156
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:09,406
Not good enough!

157
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:14,328
We're gonna send a message
to those bureaucrats...

158
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,405
...down there in the state capital!

159
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:22,806
-Is your boss governor yet?
-Not yet, son. Not yet.

160
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:27,565
-The voters see you as godlike.
-Hot dog!

161
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:31,886
But the downside is you're losing
touch with the common man.

162
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:36,450
-Oh, dear! Heaven forefend!
-So the night before the election...

163
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:40,572
...we want you to eat at the
home of one of your workers.

164
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:45,682
I see. Every Joe Meatball and Sally
Housecoat in this godforsaken state...

165
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:49,129
...will see me chow down
with Eddie Punchclock.

166
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,523
The media will have a field day.

167
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:55,971
The only question is, can we find
someone common enough?

168
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:08,448
Well, I knew there
would be sacrifices.

169
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:22,207
Great toast, Marge! Oh, by the way,
the night before the election...

170
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:24,933
-...Mr. Burns is coming to dinner.
-What!?

171
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:28,808
-And some camera crews.
-Cool, man! A media circus!

172
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:31,447
-Absolutely not!
-Come on, Marge!

173
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:34,451
I'm ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey.

174
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:39,208
Kids, please leave.
I don't want you to see this.

175
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:43,127
Please, please, please, please!

176
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:49,852
We'd like one of the children
to ask a question.

177
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,964
Can you memorize this?

178
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:56,286
"Your campaign's moving
like a runaway freight train.

179
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,365
-Why are you so popular?"
-Very good.

180
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:03,765
Can I ask him to assuage my fears
that he's contaminating the planet...

181
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,924
...and making it uninhabitable?

182
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:10,251
-The card question's fine.
-I think her question is valid--

183
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:15,368
Don't worry. I'm sure she'll be able
to memorize it by tomorrow.

184
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:20,004
Finally, Mr. Burns wants you to appear
very affectionate to him...

185
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,892
...but remember,
he hates being touched.

186
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:32,843
-Marge, get back in bed.
-No, I'm fine right here.

187
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:36,409
-I just wanna snuggle.
-I don't feel like snuggling.

188
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:40,407
-What's that got to do with it?
-You don't let me express myself.

189
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:45,693
You express yourself in the home
you keep and the food you serve.

190
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:50,322
Okay, Homer.
Fair enough. You got it.

191
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:55,971
All right. Good. That's how I'm going
to express myself. Good night.

192
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:12,325
-Well, what do we think?
-Hey! Hello, handsome!

193
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,926
Get that off his face.

194
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:17,642
We're eating with the common
man, not Tyrone Power.

195
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:21,408
Latest polls are in.
It's dead even: 50-50.

196
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,962
This stunt will put us over the top.

197
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,132
He's here!

198
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,446
Hello, Homer.
Marge, you look dazzling!

199
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:38,167
And look, I've brought noodle kugel.

200
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:46,728
You bad dog! Bad neighbor dog!
Here, let me help you up.

201
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,569
I love dogs. Babies too.

202
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,725
-Kitty, kitty.
-Are you all right, Mr. Burns?

203
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:01,961
Of course. A little roughhousing with
the pets is good for the appetite.

204
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:10,089
The way you handled the pets
put you over the top.

205
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:14,644
You're ahead 5 1 to 49.
Congratulations, Mr. Governor.

206
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,805
-Excellent.
-Bart, would you say grace?

207
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:22,125
God, we paid for all this ourselves,
so thanks for nothing.

208
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,405
Only a child could get away
with such blasphemy.

209
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:29,882
God bless them all. Amen.

210
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:32,846
He's smokin'.

211
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:42,206
You know, Mr. Burns, my family
and I feel that taxes are too high.

212
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:45,845
Where do you stand on this
controversial issue?

213
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:50,843
I didn't realize this was going to
turn into a charged political debate.

214
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:55,006
-I was only reading--
-I agree. If I am elected governor...

215
00:17:55,173 --> 00:18:00,293
...I'll lower taxes whether bureaucrats
in the state capital like it or not!

216
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:04,002
Lisa, do you have a question
for Uncle Montgomery?

217
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,329
Yes, sir. A very inane one.

218
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:12,170
Your campaign's moving
like a runaway freight train.

219
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:16,725
-Why are you so popular?
-A tough question, but a fair one.

220
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:21,409
There's no single answer.
Some voters respond to my integrity...

221
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:27,091
...others to my incorruptibility
and determination to lower taxes...

222
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:31,007
...and the bureaucrats can put that
in their pipes and smoke it!

223
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:35,805
-Oh, Mom, that felt awful.
-I'm sorry. It will all be over soon.

224
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,402
But we've become the tools of evil.

225
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:40,683
You're learning lessons tonight...

226
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:45,643
...and one of them is to give
your mother the benefit of the doubt.

227
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,327
--or even a square deal.

228
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,484
Smells delightful.

229
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:00,328
-All right! Three-eyed fish!
-Can I have your plate?

230
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:33,173
-I don't believe it!
-He's blown it!

231
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,164
Ruined before it hit the ground.

232
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:40,286
Here's your headline,
"Burns Can't Swallow Own Story."

233
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:45,573
Burns' popularity has plummeted to
earth like so much half-chewed fish.

234
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:48,691
You must have a few tricks
left up your sleeve.

235
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,048
Make coffee.
We're not licked yet.

236
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:54,410
-Yes, we are. Come on.
-Wait! Come back!

237
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:59,164
You can't do this to me!
I'm Charles Montgomery Burns!

238
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:11,252
-Smithers, tip over this table.
-Yes, sir.

239
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,330
Make them stop.

240
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,484
Mr. Burns....

241
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:20,127
Shut up and wreck something!

242
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:25,287
I hardly see what destroying our
meager possessions will accomplish.

243
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:31,005
She's right. Take me home, Smithers.
We'll destroy something tasteful.

244
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:37,651
Ironic. This anonymous clan
of slack-jawed troglodytes...

245
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:41,249
...cost me the election,
but if I had them killed...

246
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:44,809
...I'd be the one to go to jail.
That's democracy.

247
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:47,043
You're poetic in defeat, sir.

248
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:51,126
Simpson, I shall make it the focus
of my remaining years...

249
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,245
...that your dreams
will go unfulfilled.

250
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,409
You're busted, Dad.

251
00:20:56,933 --> 00:21:01,643
My dreams will go unfulfilled?
I don't like the sound of that.

252
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:06,489
That means I have nothing to hope for.
Marge, can't you make it better?

253
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:10,851
When a man's biggest dreams
include seconds on dessert...

254
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:14,892
...occasional snuggling
and sleeping in on weekends...

255
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:17,448
...no one man can destroy them.

256
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,609
Hey, you did it!

9999
