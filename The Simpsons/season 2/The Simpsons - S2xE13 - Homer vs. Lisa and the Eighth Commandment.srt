1
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:08,531
Homer vs. Lisa vs. The 8th Commandment

2
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:39,123
-Evening, Carver of Graven Images.
-Homer the Thief. How's business?

3
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:42,843
Been a little slow.
Not much to steal in the desert.

4
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:48,207
Do not worry. We'll be wandering
out here another two weeks, tops.

5
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:52,171
Zohar the Adulterer.
My wife sends her regards.

6
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:57,612
-Yes, she's a good woman. Very good.
-Thank you, my lusty friend.

7
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:09,132
-Moses is back.
-Quick! Everybody, look busy.

8
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:14,730
The Lord has handed down to us
10 commandments by which to live.

9
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:17,533
I will read them
in no particular order.

10
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:22,403
-"Thou shalt not make graven images."
-Oh, my God!

11
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:27,562
-"Thou shalt not commit adultery."
-Well, looks like the party's over.

12
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,606
Hey, Moses. Keep them coming!

13
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:33,930
"Thou shalt not steal."

14
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,161
Sorry, Homer.

15
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:46,723
That's the most dishonest thing I've
ever heard! I should box your ears!

16
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:49,043
-You sneaky Pete!
-Easy, tiger.

17
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,363
You, easy. Get off my property!

18
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:54,451
Flanders, who put that bug
up your butt?

19
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:58,009
I wanted to subscribe to the
arts and crafts channel.

20
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:01,922
They sent this man to install it.
You know what he did?

21
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:06,371
He offered to hook me up illegally
to every channel for $50.

22
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,928
Boy, what's this world coming to?

23
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:11,448
-That's exactly--
-Gotta go.

24
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,563
Hey, stop, cable man!
Stop!

25
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:22,330
-What do you want?
-I want free cable!

26
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:26,446
This is okay.
Everybody does it, right?

27
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:30,481
What? If you're having second
thoughts, read this.

28
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:33,526
"So You've Decided
to Steal Cable."

29
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,241
"Myth: Cable piracy is wrong.

30
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:41,692
Fact: Cable companies are faceless
corporations which makes it okay."

31
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:46,332
The clown that will last
a lifetime.

32
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:50,452
Cable. It's more wonderful
than I dared hope!

33
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:53,531
Don't you hate it
when you go to the toilet...

34
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:55,923
...and there's no toilet paper?

35
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:00,122
It's funny because it's true!

36
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,683
Oh, hey! Family! Family, come here.

37
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:09,047
I have an announcement to make.
The Simpsons have cable!

38
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:10,163
Cable?!

39
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:13,644
Right. 68 channels.
MTV for the kids.

40
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:18,842
VH1 for us. 1600 hours
of quality programming every day.

41
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:23,325
We've talked about cable before.
You think we can afford it?

42
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,929
Nothing a month?
Yeah, I think we can swing that.

43
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,646
Is this legal?

44
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,525
Don't worry.
Look at this.

45
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:34,766
"Myth: It's only fair to pay for
quality first-run movies.

46
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:38,244
Fact: Most movies on cable
get two stars or less...

47
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:41,132
...and are repeated ad nauseam."

48
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,041
-I don't know.
-Marge.

49
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:47,091
Hear Me Roar,
the network for women.

50
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:53,050
We'll teach you to lower your
bill by making your own Band-Aids.

51
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,403
Oh, that's a good idea.

52
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:59,686
Before we begin, you'll need
5 yards of sterilized cotton.

53
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:08,770
Pro wrestling from Mexico.
Down there, it's a real sport.

54
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:12,130
This is where Jaws eats the boat.

55
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:15,171
Here, Die Hard
jumps through the window.

56
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,132
This is where Wall Street
gets arrested.

57
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:23,532
If I could call your attention
to the Subsidy Appropriations...

58
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:27,925
...Override Bill.
I refer you to page 4500--

59
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:29,970
They think people watch that.

60
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:34,729
Live, from New Orleans. This is the
World Series of Cockfighting!

61
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,528
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun
on the bayou tonight.

62
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:42,812
We'd get there quicker
if I drove my dad's car.

63
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:47,729
-Aren't you ready for church, Homer?
-Huh? What? Okay.

64
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,011
Today's Christian doesn't think
he needs God.

65
00:05:56,213 --> 00:06:00,809
He thinks he's got it made.
He's got his hi-fi. His boob tube.

66
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,163
And his instant pizza pie.

67
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:04,846
Oh, pizza.

68
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:10,970
Children, I don't want you to get
frightened but I must teach you this.

69
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,852
Today's topic will be hell.

70
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:19,288
I sat through mercy and forgiveness.
Finally, we get to the good stuff.

71
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:23,930
Hell is terrible! Maggots are
your sheet, worms your blanket.

72
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:28,769
There's a lake of fire burning
with sulfur. You'll be tormented.

73
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:33,962
If you actually saw hell, you'd be
so frightened you would die.

74
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:35,891
-Miss Albright?
-Yes.

75
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,688
-Won't you eventually get used to it?
-No.

76
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:42,248
-Yes.
-Are there pirates in hell?

77
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,967
-Thousands of them.
-Oh, baby!

78
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:48,922
So there's a downside
to the afterlife.

79
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,733
How does one steer
clear of this?

80
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:54,328
By obeying the 10 Commandments.

81
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:57,929
Ten simple rules
that are easy to live by.

82
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:06,130
-What did you children learn about?
-Hell.

83
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:09,843
I sure as hell can't tell you we
learned about hell...

84
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,687
-...unless I say "hell."
-He has a point.

85
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:13,962
Hell, yes!

86
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:16,243
Hell, hell, hell, hell....

87
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:22,324
Bart! You're no longer in
Sunday school. Don't swear.

88
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,721
Hey, anybody up for a little
so-called pay-TV?

89
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:34,721
-Are you sure this isn't stealing?
-Read the pamphlet.

90
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,163
Hello, I'm Troy McClure.

91
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:41,924
You may remember me from Cry Yuma
and Here Comes the Coast Guard!

92
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:46,928
I'd like to talk about a candy that
cleans and straightens your teeth!

93
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,812
A program-length advertisement!

94
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:55,212
Wait a minute. I'm confused.
Did you say "cleans and straightens"?

95
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:58,405
There's no confusion.
Just good science.

96
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:02,362
Ladies and gentlemen,
the inventor, Dr. Nick Riviera.

97
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:06,049
-Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody!
-Hi, Dr. Riviera!

98
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:11,413
Now, could I have a volunteer?
Somebody with crooked, yellow teeth.

99
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:27,172
Come on, Lisa.
Watch a little cable with us.

100
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:30,132
It won't cost you a thing.

101
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:32,927
Except your soul!

102
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:38,126
-What's gotten into Lisa?
-Beats the hell out of me!

103
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:50,732
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

104
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:53,726
-Remember the 8th commandment?
-Of course.

105
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:57,648
Thou shalt not....
Covet...

106
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,492
...graven images.
Something about covet.

107
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:03,526
Thou shalt not steal!

108
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,725
Anything else?

109
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:12,008
Yes. I ate two grapes.
Please charge me for them.

110
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:14,408
Two grapes? Who cares?

111
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:17,525
-Just charge me something, please.
-Okay.

112
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:21,408
I need a price check on two grapes.
You heard me, Phil.

113
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:23,922
Two measly, stinking grapes.

114
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:28,367
If you didn't catch it
in the theater or rent it...

115
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:31,650
... we've got it!
On the Blockbuster Channel!

116
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,771
Why is the world
a cesspool of corruption?

117
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:38,124
Oh, great. All right,
what makes you say that?

118
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:41,490
In Sunday school we learned
stealing is a sin.

119
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:44,685
But everybody does it.
We're stealing cable.

120
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:49,972
-Did you pay for your breakfast?
-No.

121
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:53,205
-Did you pay for your clothes?
-No, I didn't.

122
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:56,849
Run for the hills, Ma Barker,
before I call the feds!

123
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:00,927
-I think that's pretty spurious.
-Well, thank you, honey.

124
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,205
Friday night, live.
The ultimate matchup.

125
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,445
The bout to knock
the other guy out.

126
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:10,929
Watson-Tatum Two.
This time it's for money!

127
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:14,449
-Oh, boy!
-Only on the Blockbuster Channel.

128
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:21,931
How can one little insulated wire
bring so much happiness?

129
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:28,166
Big fight coming up.

130
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:31,450
Wanna come over and
listen to it on the radio?

131
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:36,568
Okay. After the fight, we can
watch the still photos on the news.

132
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:38,968
Not too shabby!
What do you say?

133
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,563
We could do that, yeah.

134
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:47,125
Or we could go over to my house
and watch it live on cable TV!

135
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:50,524
-Get off!
-You're kidding me!

136
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:52,525
Pass the pumice, please.

137
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,963
He's Homer from sector 7-G.

138
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:59,325
Excellent. I'm so keen on seeing
Watson vs. Tatum Two...

139
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:03,930
...I'd even go to an employee's house.
I can picture it now.

140
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:07,165
The screen door resting off
its hinges.

141
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:11,611
Mangy dog staggering about
looking vainly for a place to die.

142
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:13,883
-May I speak frankly?
-Yes.

143
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:18,530
-You are quite wealthy.
-Thank you. Your candor is refreshing.

144
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:21,412
Why don't you pay for
the fight yourself?

145
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:27,131
The big fight is one of those rare
occasions that I savor the sights...

146
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:31,326
...the sounds and the smells
of other men.

147
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:33,529
You haven't lost the common touch.

148
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:38,012
-So, Homer, I hear you got the fight.
-That's right.

149
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:42,252
-8:00, my place. Come one, come all.
-All right.

150
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:45,843
Moe, how come you never got
cable for the bar?

151
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:49,523
Well, it was either cable
or the mechanical bull.

152
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:52,293
I made my choice and I stand by it.

153
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,526
-Somebody's having a party.
-Friday night. Wanna come over?

154
00:11:58,773 --> 00:12:03,085
No, thanks. I'm open 24 hours.
It puts great demands on my time.

155
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:05,727
Too bad.
It'll be a great fight.

156
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:10,171
The fight! I'll get my brother,
Sanjay, to cover for me.

157
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,722
He deplores violence.

158
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:18,130
If a man takes bread to feed his
starving family, that's stealing?

159
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,292
No. It is if he puts anything
on it. Jelly, for example.

160
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:23,721
I see.

161
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:28,012
You're here for a reason.
Is your father stealing bread?

162
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:33,526
I don't watch him every minute.
But we're getting cable for free.

163
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:38,643
I'm afraid that is stealing.
I think you must do something.

164
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:43,131
-Should I have him arrested?
-That seems like an ideal solution.

165
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:48,282
But remember the 5th commandment:
"Honor thy father and thy mother."

166
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:54,243
I would like to see you
set an example by not watching...

167
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:57,963
-...the offending technology yourself.
-Thank you.

168
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:03,327
You're watching Top Hat Entertainment.
Adult programming all day, every day.

169
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:08,732
Except in Florida and Utah.
Coming up next, Stardust Mammaries.

170
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,652
-Ay, carumba!
-Bart!

171
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:17,766
-Here's what I was looking for.
-Blue chips closed up 3 3/4.

172
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:20,322
Oil service stocks slumped....

173
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,366
You shouldn't watch
that other channel.

174
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:26,923
It's for mommies and daddies
who love each other.

175
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,688
-Promise me you won't ever watch it.
-Okay.

176
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,532
-Promise me.
-I promise I won't watch it.

177
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:35,172
-Good boy.
-Hi, Dad.

178
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:38,610
Stealing cable is wrong,
so I'm not watching it...

179
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:43,489
...in the hope that others will
follow my example. Thank you.

180
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:47,163
Hey, Lisa. Racing from Belmont?
Horsies!

181
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:49,927
Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven.

182
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:54,122
There's something wrong
with that kid. She's so moral.

183
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,962
Why can't she be more like...?
Well, not like Bart.

184
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:02,047
-But there's gotta be a happy medium.
-Well, you know....

185
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,767
Bart was looking at that
racy movie.

186
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:08,124
And Lisa is losing
a little respect for you.

187
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:12,127
Maybe we should think about
unhooking the cable.

188
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:16,525
-Unhook it? But I love cable!
-Then you should pay for it.

189
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:21,051
I can't afford it. When I can
afford to pay for it, I will.

190
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,648
But I can't
so I'm not going to.

191
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:27,482
Cable has become an evil presence
in our home.

192
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:32,130
Marge, I never put my foot down
about anything.

193
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:34,762
But I'm severely tempted
to do it.

194
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,567
-No.
-I'm sorry, it's coming down.

195
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:40,247
-No.
-It's coming down. That's it!

196
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:44,725
It's coming down! The cable stays.
The foot has spoken.

197
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:49,048
-Lemonade? Please.
-Seen it.

198
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,887
-Cleans and straightens--
-Seen it.

199
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:54,049
-Seen it.
-I was poor.

200
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:56,972
Soccer. Seen it.

201
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,169
-Simpson.
-How did you get in?

202
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:02,132
Your door wasn't locked well enough.

203
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:06,127
Would you be interested
in this stereo? A $500 value.

204
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,329
You can have it for $40.

205
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,724
-Get out! Criminal!
-I'll go see a neighbor.

206
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:15,130
-He's not home!
-Even better.

207
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:22,765
You sure about this?
Doesn't look friendly.

208
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:26,130
Can't be too careful.
Thieves are everywhere.

209
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,729
I'm not talking about
the small, forgivable stuff.

210
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:33,642
Come one, come all!
Top Hat Theater is on the air!

211
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:38,967
The most beautiful women! Just 50
cents! I'm your host, Bart Simpson!

212
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,932
You must be at least
8 years old.

213
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:48,928
And now The Top Hat Channel is
proud to present Broadcast Nudes.

214
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:53,769
-Gross!
-Yet strangely compelling.

215
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:56,163
-It's a raid!
-What the--?

216
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,768
I know you. Come back here!

217
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:06,850
You promised me you wouldn't watch
that trash. Go to your room!

218
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,931
I wish I was an adult
so I could break rules.

219
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:11,162
Oh, great.

220
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:18,729
-I brought some imported generic beer.
-Thank you, Barney.

221
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,562
-How many people are coming?
-Just a select circle.

222
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:25,566
Hello!
I brought an assortment of jerkies.

223
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:30,728
-Did you swipe those from work?
-Certainly not. What are you implying?

224
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:34,329
There is no love lost between
these two warriors.

225
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,929
We almost had a scuffle
today at the weigh-in.

226
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:41,370
You have a special motivation
going into this bout.

227
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:46,403
I want to dedicate this fight to
my manager, Vinnie, who got me here...

228
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:47,932
...and then...

229
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:52,164
-...passed away two weeks ago.
-Any response?

230
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:56,366
I would also like to dedicate
this fight to this manager.

231
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,251
-You can't!
-I can!

232
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,371
You dedicate the fight
to your manager!

233
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:05,128
I want to tell you
that I'm not watching this fight.

234
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,325
It's my form of nonviolent protest.

235
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,644
Hi, Homer. I brought you--

236
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:16,932
Quick! It's Moe.
I gotta hide the mugs.

237
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:25,124
Will you get--? Hey, go protest
outside, will you? Now!

238
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,932
-Hi. I brought you a mug.
-Thank you.

239
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:32,448
I always wanted one of these.

240
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:36,124
Oh! Mr. Burns!

241
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:40,683
-Hide the stuff I borrowed from work!
-Borrowed?

242
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,329
-Okay, that stuff I stole from work.
-Oh, okay.

243
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:51,765
Come on! Take all this.
Put it in the closet.

244
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,481
Will you quit staring at me
like that?

245
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:59,764
Hello. We were in the neighborhood
and thought we'd drop by.

246
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,410
Hello, Mr. Burns.
Like to watch the fight?

247
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:06,843
The fight! Don't mind if I do.

248
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:11,166
Oh, Simpson. Good news.
I brought some munchies.

249
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,523
Smithers, the Cheetos.

250
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:20,402
In but a few scant minutes,
the anticipation--

251
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:23,162
-Simpson?
-Yes.

252
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:26,564
-You have an illegal cable hookup.
-No. No, l--

253
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:29,930
It wasn't me.
It was my wife's idea. Yeah!

254
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,126
Hey, hey, hey.

255
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:33,852
Settle down, fella.

256
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,926
We were hoping
we could watch the fight.

257
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,522
Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest.

258
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:47,722
-Here's lemonade for your protest.
-Thanks, Mom.

259
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,965
-It isn't going very well.
-Don't give up.

260
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,205
When you love somebody,
you must have faith...

261
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:56,921
...that they will do the right thing.

262
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:01,332
He learned how to fight
in the projects of Capital City...

263
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,122
...and honed his skills while
serving time for assault...

264
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:07,523
...in Springfield Prison.

265
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,327
All right! A local boy!

266
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:14,890
For 5 years, I was away from
my kids and their mothers.

267
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:17,448
The conditions were irrevocable.

268
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:22,329
Assault. Manslaughter.
Stealing cable TV!

269
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,926
Marge! Lisa! Maggie!

270
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,646
Shake hands. Keep it clean.

271
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,287
Come on, boy!

272
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:43,201
Excuse me.
I hate to interrupt your judging me.

273
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:46,445
I've made a couple of
important decisions.

274
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:50,322
Number one: I'm cutting the cable
when the fight's over.

275
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:53,804
Number two: I'm not very fond
of any of you.

276
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:56,129
-Back to the fight.
-Get down!

277
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:58,682
We may have saved your soul.

278
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:00,770
Tatum is reeling!

279
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:04,124
Yeah, at the worst possible time.

280
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:07,970
Eight! Nine! Ten!

281
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:12,366
This fight is history!
It's done!

282
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:16,452
A stunning knockout by a thunderous
punch in the 12th round.

283
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,366
Tatum is the new champion
of the world!

284
00:20:19,573 --> 00:20:23,691
Everyone to my place for
squishies and microwave burritos.

285
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:27,764
Best fight ever and I missed it.

286
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:29,924
We're really proud of you.

287
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:32,368
-What a donnybrook!
-Hogwash!

288
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:38,165
I once watched Jim Corbett fight an
Eskimo bare-knuckled for 113 rounds!

289
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:42,850
Back then, if it was less than 50
rounds, we demanded our nickel back!

290
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:46,127
-Cable clippers.
-Here you go.

291
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,325
-Go for it, Dad.
-I beg you to reconsider.

292
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:54,328
Tractor pulls. Atlanta Braves
baseball. Joe Franklin!

293
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,567
Third time's a charm.
