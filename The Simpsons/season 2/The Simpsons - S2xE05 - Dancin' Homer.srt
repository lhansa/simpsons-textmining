1
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:09,444
Dancin' Homer

2
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:24,489
-So, what happened in Capital City?
-Oh, Barney.

3
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,763
We're dying of curiosity.

4
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:30,170
The only thing worse
than being a loser...

5
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:34,525
...is being a guy telling the story
of how he became a loser.

6
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:38,448
-I don't want that to happen to me.
-Please, Homer?

7
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:39,847
Well, okay.

8
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:45,366
It was "Nuclear Plant Employee, Spouses
and No-More-Than-Three-Kids Night"...

9
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:48,087
...down at Springfield Stadium.

10
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:54,449
I think we lost them.
And we're at the ballpark! All right!

11
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:58,532
Two birds with one stone!
Okay, everybody out!

12
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:06,324
Some of the players you see
may make it to the big leagues.

13
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:11,402
-Will we see washed-up major leaguers?
-Sure, there's a nice mix.

14
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:15,811
There's no better place to spend
a balmy summers' night.

15
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:19,892
The grass of the outfield,
the brick of the infield...

16
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:23,972
...and the chalk lines that divide
the man from the boy.

17
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:28,644
Lisa, you're forgetting the beer.
It comes in 72-ounce tubs.

18
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:32,129
-Space out the tubs this year.
-What do you mean?

19
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,121
Last year you got rambunctious
and mooned the umpire.

20
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,564
Marge, this ticket
doesn't just give me a seat.

21
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:46,042
It also gives me the right, no, the duty
to make a complete ass of myself.

22
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:48,813
The Gammills! Good to see you.

23
00:02:49,013 --> 00:02:52,323
You're an inspiration to us
in Waste Management.

24
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:57,084
Forget about contaminants
for one night and have a hot dog.

25
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:01,286
-Put a smile on his card, Smithers.
-Already there, sir.

26
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:05,927
-The Simpsons, sir.
-Well, if it isn't the Simps.

27
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,772
Oh, the Simpsons, sir.

28
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:12,166
Oh, yes. Homer and Marge Simpson.

29
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:16,207
Oh, and these must be Bart,
Lisa and Expecting.

30
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:19,166
The card needs to be updated, sir.

31
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:23,127
That's okay. The baby's name
isn't important. Let's go.

32
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,689
Red Hots! Get your Red Hots here!

33
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:34,732
Flash Bailor! I gotta get
his autograph. He was a star.

34
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:37,288
-Will you sign my ball?
-No.

35
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:41,408
Lousy, washed-up,
broken-down tub of guts!

36
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,173
-Who does he think he is?
-What's wrong?

37
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:47,604
-He won't sign my ball.
-He's a fine role model.

38
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,247
Bart, give me that ball.

39
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:53,172
Check out the mature quail
heading over.

40
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:56,365
Little lady,
what can Flash do for you?

41
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,532
Here you go, Bart.

42
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:04,126
"Springfield Kozy Kort Motel, Room 26.
How about it? Flash."

43
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,962
Wow, Flash Bailor came on to my wife!

44
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,971
You've still got the magic, Marge.

45
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:14,245
Hey, Dad, look!
You're on Jumbo-Vision!

46
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,842
Hey, everybody! How you doing?

47
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:21,490
Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson!

48
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:25,371
Homer. Homer! X-Y-Z.

49
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:27,689
Examine my zipper? Why?

50
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:34,090
-Thanks, everybody.
-Throwing out tonight's first ball...

51
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:38,684
...the man whose name is synonymous
with the safest energy source:

52
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:42,090
Mr. Montgomery Burns!

53
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:45,522
-They love you.
-As they should.

54
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,849
When I was a young buck...

55
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:53,571
...my fade-away pitch was compared
to the trouble ball of Satchel Paige.

56
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:58,051
-Spit on this for me, Smithers.
-One hawker coming up, sir.

57
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:04,284
What a lame-o!

58
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:08,122
-I could hear the air being torn, sir.
-Oh, shut up!

59
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,130
Hey, Burns! Hey, rag arm!

60
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:14,326
-You throw like my sister!
-Yeah, you throw like me!

61
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,321
To honor America, please rise
for our national anthem...

62
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:23,891
...sung by Springfield's R & B
sensation, "Bleeding Gums" Murphy.

63
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:32,643
Dan Horde, mikeside. Our Isotopes take
on the Shelbyville Shelbyvillians.

64
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:36,812
We look to snap the longest
losing streak in pro baseball.

65
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,766
How about that?
We're in the record book!

66
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:43,529
Sitting with the employees
proves I'm their friend.

67
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:47,328
Get me an aisle seat.
I don't want to be surrounded.

68
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,364
Let's go! Swing, batter!

69
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:54,852
-We want a pitcher, not an itcher!
-We want a catcher, not a scratcher!

70
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:57,487
-Here we are, sir.
-Oh, no!

71
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:05,526
Sitting next to the boss. The best
night of the year and it's ruined.

72
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,530
Of all the lousy, rotten....

73
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:11,487
It just means you can't wave
your fanny in public.

74
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:13,684
Rub it in.

75
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:19,930
-Beer here! Duff Beer!
-Beer. Did you hear that, Marge?

76
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:25,526
Delicious, frosty beer. Fat lot of
good it does me sitting next to Burns.

77
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:26,927
Now, Homer.

78
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:29,772
-I suppose you want a beer?
-Me, sir?

79
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,851
Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer.

80
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,170
I wonder if you'd join me. My treat.

81
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:41,891
If someone of your stature can enjoy a
beer, maybe I'm wrong on the subject.

82
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:46,484
-Are we having a drug test tomorrow?
-No. Vendor, two, please.

83
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:49,252
2.50.

84
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:55,927
The hitter's off his rocker,
kissing Betty Crocker!

85
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:57,447
Good one, sir!

86
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:02,329
I used to rile Connie Mack
with that one at old Shibe Park.

87
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,923
Little baby batter,
can't control his bladder!

88
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:08,124
Crude, but I like it.

89
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,372
What do you say we freshen up
our little drinkie-poos?

90
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,450
Don't mind if I do.

91
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:22,687
-Well, Simpsie, up for another wave?
-All right, Burnsie.

92
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:29,969
Bases loaded,
'Topes have 1 out, down by 3.

93
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:33,051
Swung on and missed.
Strike 3, of course.

94
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:36,882
These banjos couldn't carry
Pie Traynor's glove.

95
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:41,052
After Bill McCIoskey pops out,
our post-game show starts.

96
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:45,087
Come on! All we need is a grand slam!

97
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:51,293
My one game of the year,
ruined by pathetic incompetence!

98
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,451
What's wrong with you?
Show some spirit!

99
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,850
Your team needs you! Come on!

100
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:04,366
As I got up, I felt an intoxication
that had nothing to do with alcohol.

101
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:08,248
It was the intoxication
of being a public spectacle.

102
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,364
Some nut's dancing!

103
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:16,330
He has the crowd going. Can he shake
up mediocre slugger Bill McCloskey?

104
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:23,283
Swung on and belted
to deep left field!

105
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:26,926
Going, going, gone! It's out of here!

106
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:32,810
Oh, my God! The Isotopes win a game!
The Isotopes win a game!

107
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,527
-That was certainly exciting.
-Yes.

108
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:40,932
But Simpson's shameless display
of exhibitionism tainted the evening.

109
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,409
He's banned for life
from all company outings.

110
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:48,367
Way to go, Homer.

111
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:53,522
Thank you. You're too kind,
but I can't take all the credit.

112
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,008
The batter did his part too.

113
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,727
Excuse me. You, the dancing fella.

114
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,164
I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara.
I own the Isotopes.

115
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:08,289
-Would you like to be our mascot?
-Me? A mascot for a bush-league team?

116
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:12,247
I should've slept on it,
or at least stared blankly.

117
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:17,447
If I hadn't thought of a nickname,
all our lives might've been spared.

118
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:22,927
-Get on the bus, Dancing Homer!
-Shut up! I'm thinking of a name!

119
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,362
Well, I'm ready to punch in.

120
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:33,565
-Hey, cool, man!
-Our lives have taken an odd turn.

121
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:38,051
-Did they ask you to dress like that?
-No, this was my idea.

122
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:42,531
Don't fill up on those vegetables.
Save room for nachos.

123
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,246
All right!

124
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:51,766
For the first time, people didn't
laugh at me. They laughed towards me.

125
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:54,802
'Topes win! Two in a row!

126
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:08,972
A Simpson on a T-shirt!
I never thought I'd see the day.

127
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,125
I'll stick this
where the sun don't shine.

128
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,848
Oh yeah? And where might that be?

129
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,683
I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight.

130
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:33,852
Give me "Baby Elephant Walk"
with a little reggae beat.

131
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:46,329
-Go, Dancing Homer! Get up, man!
-Lively up yourself, Dancing Homer.

132
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:55,492
Bases loaded, two outs.
The good guys trail by a run.

133
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:59,565
S-P-R-...

134
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:02,412
...-l-N-G-...

135
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:05,286
...-F-E-E-L-D!

136
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,245
Springfield!

137
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:11,492
Here's the pitch.
Swung on and missed. Strike three.

138
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:13,012
'Topes lose.

139
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:16,922
'Topes lose. 'Topes lose.

140
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:23,251
You wanted to see me?

141
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:28,891
Now we both knew when you began doing
this, you wouldn't be here forever.

142
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:32,881
You can't fire the players,
so you fire the mascot!

143
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:35,926
-You make me sick.
-I'm not firing you.

144
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:39,170
You've been called up to Capital City.

145
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:41,648
-Me? The majors?
-That's right.

146
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:46,005
Wait, Capital City has a mascot.
The greatest one there is:

147
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,044
The Capital City Goofball.

148
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:52,849
He's getting old, needs someone
to fill in a few innings a night.

149
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:55,613
-Could be a big opportunity.
-I'll say!

150
00:12:55,813 --> 00:13:00,443
-Why don't you talk to your family?
-Because they might say no.

151
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:05,966
This was a big decision. I should've
listened to my kids, not my dumb wife.

152
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:09,404
I shouldn't call her that.
Bite my tongue.

153
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:13,162
I can't go! I was born here.
I thought I'd die here.

154
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:16,524
It's not so bad.
You'll die someplace else.

155
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:21,568
-What do I do about friends?
-You'll make new, better friends.

156
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:25,288
But, Dad, we're simple people
with simple values.

157
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:30,613
Capital City is too complex. Everyone
here knows us and has forgiven us.

158
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:34,522
I'd be lying if I didn't say
this scares me a little.

159
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:38,965
But we all have a calling,
a reason God put us on this earth.

160
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:41,129
Yours is dancing on dugouts.

161
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,244
-You mean--?
-Let's do it!

162
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:45,444
Let's never look back!

163
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:49,487
Whatever doesn't kill me
can only make me stronger.

164
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:53,891
I've gotta convince my supervisor
to give me time off.

165
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:57,210
Sure. What would you like?
Four, five years?

166
00:13:57,413 --> 00:14:00,450
So you're really moving
to Capital City?

167
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,486
-That's right.
-And all this is for sale?

168
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,253
I don't know how to say this, but....

169
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:09,650
Knock it off.
Don't start blubbering on me.

170
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:12,162
I'm gonna miss you too. Not.

171
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,570
I don't know.
I'll miss you and all, but--

172
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:18,970
Milhouse, this way,
we'll be friends forever.

173
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:21,129
Well, okay.

174
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:27,412
-I'll miss you, spit brother.
-I'll miss you, spit brother.

175
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:34,521
If we had known each other better, my
leaving would actually mean something.

176
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:40,605
We have one quick stop,
and then it's on to Capital City.

177
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,885
I can't believe it. Our baby sister.

178
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:46,323
-I'll call every day.
-Me too.

179
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:50,485
Look. He can use a horn.

180
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:52,732
Oh, shut up!

181
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:59,361
Some may say that I have been
given a bad break in life.

182
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:03,691
Little education,
bald as a cue ball...

183
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:08,131
...10 years on the same job
for the same salary.

184
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:12,572
But today,
as I leave for Capital City...

185
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:19,049
...I consider myself the luckiest
mascot on the face of the earth.

186
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:27,531
With the fickle fans
already forgetting me...

187
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:31,282
...I was ready to take
the biggest step of my life.

188
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:41,849
Well, kids. There it is! Capital City!

189
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:45,489
Look! The Crosstown Bridge.

190
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:47,604
-Wow!
-Wow.

191
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,281
The Pennyloafer!

192
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,851
Kids, look! Street crime.

193
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,772
Wow, that's service.

194
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:24,045
-Look, it's Tony Bennett!
-Hey, good to see you.

195
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:38,326
Fourth Street and D!

196
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,922
The Duff Brewery!

197
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:05,765
Capital City, yeah!

198
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:14,766
C-A-P-I....

199
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:19,412
-Come to bed, Homie.
-Sorry, honey.

200
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:22,213
I'm just a little nervous.

201
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:27,445
We would talk about it always:
For the first time ever...

202
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:30,770
...Marge fell asleep before I did.

203
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:34,648
Okay, here are your tickets.

204
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,323
You're with the players' wives.
Cheer for me.

205
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:41,172
See you afterwards when you're a star.

206
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,125
Bart was strangely quiet.

207
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,962
Later, he said he was confused
by his respect for me.

208
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:48,925
It wouldn't last.

209
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,524
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
It's you!

210
00:17:56,733 --> 00:18:00,726
-The Capital City Goofball.
-Hello, glad to have you.

211
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,528
If you need anything,
just squeeze the wheeze.

212
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:11,491
The 5th inning will be yours. Everyone
is settled in, had a couple of beers.

213
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:14,161
-It's an important inning.
-The 5th.

214
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:18,412
It's also the inning
I wish I had a zipper in the front.

215
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:22,572
-Right, Mr. Goofball.
-Call me Goof. What's your plan?

216
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:27,642
I dance and spell out the name
of the city to "Baby Elephant Walk."

217
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:30,321
Mancini: the mascot's best friend.

218
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:34,811
See you on that field.
I set them up, you knock them down.

219
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:43,726
Dave Glass talking at you. We got
great weather tonight under the dome.

220
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:49,010
Let's see.
Upper, upper, upper mezzanine.

221
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:53,527
-Yes, these must be ours.
-These seats stink!

222
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:59,012
-I thought the wives would be closer.
-This section is for the ex-wives.

223
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:04,446
-He had some bimbo in Kansas City.
-Throw at his head!

224
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:11,652
A free ticket to a big-league park,
but I was too tense to enjoy the game.

225
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:15,482
I was too focused on the task at hand.

226
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:18,969
-Red Hots! Get your Red Hots!
-Ooh, Red Hots.

227
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:25,009
Ladies and gentlemen, Capital City's
newest sensation: Dancin' Homer!

228
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:29,090
These do taste better at the ballpark.

229
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:32,685
There he is!

230
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:37,250
I was graceful. I was witty.
Brother, I was something!

231
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,808
But they didn't care.

232
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:44,012
What is with these people?

233
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:47,125
-What's he doing wrong?
-I don't know.

234
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,042
It was so quiet,
I could hear each smart-ass remark.

235
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:56,168
-He doesn't make me want to cheer.
-I pity him, making a fool of himself.

236
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:59,763
These cornball antics
don't play in Capital City!

237
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:03,090
The only applause I got
was for leaving.

238
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:08,730
Mr. Showmanship, the owner wants
to see you in his office.

239
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:13,882
I'm sorry, you're not ready. Pick up
your check. And put some clothes on!

240
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:16,209
Well, back to Springfield.

241
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:19,530
I can't!
Not after I've seen Capital City!

242
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:22,241
I'll wither and die like a flower.

243
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:26,731
Stop it. Don't look too down.
It's hard enough for your dad.

244
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:31,563
-All right, Homer! Way to go!
-What a family.

245
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,729
My wife and kids stood by me.

246
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:37,562
On the way home,
I realized how little that helped.

247
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:40,651
So that's it.
The costume's buried now.

248
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:44,607
As my son would say,
I'm one sad, ape-like dude.

249
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:46,326
-Wow.
-What a saga.

250
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:51,448
You guys are hanging on my every word.
I'm the center of attention.

251
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:54,406
-It's riveting.
-Tell it again, Homer.

252
00:20:54,613 --> 00:21:00,324
I wonder why stories of degradation
and humiliation make you more popular.

253
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:03,923
I don't know. They just do.
