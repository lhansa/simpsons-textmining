1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,490
<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:38,961
D'oh!

3
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:01,697
Good morning, world!

4
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,034
Ow!

5
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:06,768
Ow... ow...

6
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:09,199
Good morning, Lisa.

7
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:11,367
What are you so happy about?

8
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:12,603
Why shouldn't I be happy?

9
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:15,044
It's a beautiful day,
my homework is done...

10
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:18,277
I got my mojo working,
and we're going on a field trip...

11
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,282
this afternoon.

12
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,943
<i>And looks like I got me...</i>

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,387
a genuine glow-in-the-dark
police badge.

14
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:26,754
Hmm...

15
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:30,027
Hey, it's not in here.

16
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,323
You stole it!

17
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:34,059
No one wants
your stupid police badge, Bart.

18
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,725
Hey, look what I got--

19
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,735
a genuine official police badge.

20
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:38,770
Calling all cars.

21
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:40,771
Come out with your hands up.

22
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,670
Hey, that's my badge, Homer.

23
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,265
<i>That's Officer Homer.</i>

24
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:48,607
Lousy prize-grabbing,
badge-wearing...

25
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:49,238
Aah!

26
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,374
You ate my homework?

27
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:57,345
I didn't know dogs
really did that.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,328
Wait! Wait!

29
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,113
D'oh!

30
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:26,879
Bart Simpson, you're late.

31
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:28,544
Go fill out a tardy slip.

32
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,714
But I'm only five...
1 0, 20... 40 minutes?

33
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,280
That's pretty damn late.

34
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:35,223
Come on, over this way.

35
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:36,318
Hey, girls...

36
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:37,327
look at me!

37
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,226
You can stop looking at me now.

38
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,392
Ooh!

39
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,462
Well, it's nearly 1 :00.

40
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:47,971
You know what that means.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,838
That's right--
it's time for our field trip...

42
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,809
to the chocolate factory.

43
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,472
Did you remember
your permission slips?

44
00:02:55,547 --> 00:03:00,849
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

45
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,409
Ugh!

46
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:05,685
Oh, what a day.

47
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:08,022
I'm going to eat
eight pieces of chocolate.

48
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:09,856
I'll eat it till I barf.

49
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:12,355
Don't worry, Bart.

50
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,865
We'll find something
fun for you to do.

51
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,197
Here's a whole box
of unsealed envelopes...

52
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:18,531
for the P.T.A.

53
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:20,367
You're making me lick envelopes?

54
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,202
Licking envelopes can be fun.

55
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,866
Just make a game of it.

56
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,204
What kind of game?

57
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:27,711
Well, see how many
you can lick in an hour.

58
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,543
Then try to break
that record.

59
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,708
Sounds like
a pretty crappy game.

60
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:33,718
Yes, well, get started.

61
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:40,884
Oh, my God!

62
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,894
It's Cocoa Beanie himself.

63
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:46,897
I think this is something
Bart would have enjoyed...

64
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:49,229
but it's the only way
he'll learn.

65
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,236
Uh... uh...
children, please.

66
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:54,204
Uh...

67
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:55,831
Welcome to
the chocolate factory.

68
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm Troy McClure.

69
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,339
You probably remember me
from such films...

70
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,345
<i>as The Revenge of Abe Lincoln...</i>

71
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,779
<i>and The Wackiest Covered Wagon
in the West.</i>

72
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:07,114
The history of chocolate
starts with the ancient Aztecs.

73
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:08,619
In those days...

74
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:11,451
instead of being wrapped
in a hygienic package...

75
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:12,785
chocolate was wrapped...

76
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:14,120
in a tobacco leaf.

77
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:15,785
Instead of being pure chocolate...

78
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,123
like we have today...

79
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:19,130
it was mixed
with shredded tobacco...

80
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:20,756
and they didn't eat it--

81
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,801
they smoked it.

82
00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:24,130
You didn't believe me...

83
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:26,797
when I said it would be fun,
did you?

84
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:28,362
No, thir.

85
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,790
My glasses!

86
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:54,388
Please, kids, play sanitary.

87
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:05,336
Tan I doe now?

88
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,672
What?

89
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:07,712
''Tan...

90
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:11,408
I... doe... now?''

91
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:12,848
Hmm...

92
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,182
Well, there's still
a minute to go.

93
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:16,346
Oh, why not?

94
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,355
But don't you tell your teacher...

95
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:19,947
I let you go early.

96
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:20,957
Die don't.

97
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:31,759
Aaaaah!

98
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:33,361
Ugh!... Aah!... Unh!...

99
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:34,666
Son of a b... Oof!.

100
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,265
What next?

101
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:39,149
Uh-oh.

102
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:46,321
What's with the kid?

103
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,448
Hands off
the material.

104
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:48,582
What do you know?

105
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,785
The kid's tough.

106
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,827
He's got spunk.

107
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:52,919
I wonder if he is lucky also.

108
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:54,122
Pick a horse, kid.

109
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:55,664
Shelbyville Downs, third race.

110
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:56,721
Make it good.

111
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,926
Eat my shorts.

112
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,127
Eat My Shorts.

113
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,499
Okay, let's see.

114
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:03,096
Hey, wait a minute,
you little punk!

115
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:04,572
That's the fifth race.

116
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,336
I said the third race.

117
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,434
Don't have a cow.

118
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:09,911
Don't Have a Cow
in the third.

119
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,914
Put a deuce on him.

120
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:15,509
While we are waiting,
let me show you around.

121
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:16,917
This is our bar...

122
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,751
and our slot machine
and card tables.

123
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:21,017
Cool.

124
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,355
Boss, here's the call
for the third race.

125
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:25,725
It's Suffering Succotash
by a neck...

126
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:30,597
over Yabba-Dabba-Do, Ain't I
a Stinker, and That's All Folks.

127
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,262
Here comes Don't Have a Cow
flying on the outside...

128
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:35,930
and it's Don't Have a Cow.

129
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:37,371
I like this kid.

130
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:39,375
And we were
gonna shoot him.

131
00:06:39,443 --> 00:06:40,705
Can you mix drinks?

132
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:41,801
I don't know.

133
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,038
I'll have a Manhattan.

134
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,478
Make Legs a Manhattan.

135
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,015
I'm not sure I...

136
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:49,208
Mmm, mmm...

137
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:51,220
Mm-hmm.

138
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:07,635
Well?

139
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,569
Su-perb.

140
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:14,241
<i>You got a job? Doing what?</i>

141
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:15,437
Uh, I don't know.

142
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:16,911
Mixing drinks,
picking horses...

143
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,572
cutting cigars-- a job.

144
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:21,914
Your father and I
don't want you doing that.

145
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,418
Homer, say something.

146
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,920
What does it pay?

147
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:25,818
Thirty bucks a week.

148
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,085
I make more than that.

149
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:51,175
I was looking for those.

150
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:52,374
Thanks, doll.

151
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:12,627
Duh...

152
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,000
It's funny because it's true.

153
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:21,101
Well observed.

154
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:27,549
Chief Wiggum, you honor us
with your presence.

155
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,244
Baloney! I won't rest...

156
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,083
until one of us
is behind bars--you.

157
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,749
You know anything
about a cigarette truck...

158
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:36,918
that got hijacked
on Route 401 ?

159
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,051
What's a truck?

160
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:39,925
Don't play dumb with me.

161
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:40,928
Relax, Chief.

162
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:42,294
You seem tense.

163
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:45,357
You know, the boy here
makes an excellent Manhattan.

164
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:46,493
Ah!

165
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,868
I'm still going
to put you away.

166
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,065
Good for you.

167
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:55,570
Bart! Have you
started smoking?

168
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:56,577
No.

169
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:58,170
Don't lie to me, boy.

170
00:08:58,248 --> 00:08:59,374
Uh-huh! Cigarettes.

171
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,076
Just as I thought.

172
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:03,585
My boss said
his warehouse was full.

173
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:04,620
Yeah, right.

174
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:06,849
I'm going to teach you
a lesson.

175
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,413
I'm going to stand here...

176
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:11,757
and watch you smoke
every one of those cigarettes.

177
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:13,295
Then maybe you'll learn.

178
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,729
Fat Tony sent me over
to pick up the goods.

179
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,891
In here, my man.

180
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,231
You look good
with that cigarette--

181
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:20,701
kind of sophisticated.

182
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,171
Son, I'll never
doubt you again.

183
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,470
The contents
of the hijacked truck...

184
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:28,306
some 1 2,000 cartons
of Laramie 1 00s.

185
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,242
We have... Please!

186
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:33,179
We have a number of leads...

187
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,718
and let me assure
all you smokers...

188
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:37,720
there is no shortage
of cigarettes.

189
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,312
How do we know that?

190
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:42,119
Let me refer that
back toJack Larson...

191
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,784
of Laramie Tobacco Products.

192
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,327
Thank you, Chief.

193
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:48,922
Folks, I'm pleased to announce
that a new truckload of Laramies...

194
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:52,264
<i>with their smooth good taste
and rich tobacco flavor...</i>

195
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,269
is already heading
toward Springfield...

196
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:56,464
and the driver
has been instructed...

197
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,668
to ignore all stop signs
and crosswalks.

198
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:02,109
Police suspect the involvement
of reputed mobster...

199
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:04,670
William ''Fat Tony'' Williams.

200
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:07,876
Fat Tony is a cancer
on this fair city...

201
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,282
and I am the...

202
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:11,684
Uh, what cures cancer?

203
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:13,780
Bart, is your boss a crook?

204
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:15,347
I don't think so...

205
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:17,586
although
it would explain...

206
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:18,821
an awful lot.

207
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:20,692
Me and the boys thank you...

208
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:22,994
for hanging on to this for us.

209
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,294
Thanks.

210
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,959
Uh... say...

211
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:27,731
are you guys crooks?

212
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,796
Bart, um... is it wrong
to steal a loaf of bread...

213
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:32,808
to feed
your starving family?

214
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:33,968
No.

215
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:35,807
For a large
starving family...

216
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,643
is it wrong to steal
a truckload of bread?

217
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:39,875
Uh-uh.

218
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,714
And what if your family
don't like bread?

219
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:43,912
They like... cigarettes.

220
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,420
I guess that's okay.

221
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:47,820
Now, what if instead
of giving them away...

222
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,415
you sold them
at a price...

223
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:51,653
that was practically
giving them away?

224
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:53,958
Would that
be a crime?

225
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,395
Hell no.

226
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:56,932
Enjoy your gift.

227
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,328
Su-perb.

228
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:14,175
Give me three fingers
of milk, Ma.

229
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:18,585
It's good he has
a part-time job...

230
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,952
but I'm not sure...

231
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:21,957
about the people
Bart's working for.

232
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,424
I think they're criminals.

233
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:24,858
Ajob's a job.

234
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:28,227
If my plant pollutes the water
and poisons the town...

235
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:31,426
by your logic,
that would make me a criminal.

236
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,435
Bart's been acting
very strangely...

237
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,437
and that pizza delivery truck...

238
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:38,531
has been parked
across the street for two weeks.

239
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:41,270
How long does it take
to deliver a pizza?

240
00:11:41,344 --> 00:11:42,470
Our cover's blown.

241
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:43,477
Let's roll.

242
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,447
See? It was all
your imagination.

243
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:50,247
Homer, I want you to go
down to that club...

244
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,548
and talk to them.

245
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:54,055
See what kind
of people they are.

246
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:56,058
Please, Homie.

247
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:57,787
Oh, all right.

248
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:01,694
Hmm.

249
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,094
Read 'em and weep, boys.

250
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:06,430
Another pair of sixes.

251
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:07,868
Beats me.

252
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,166
I was bluffing.

253
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,763
You win again,
Homer.

254
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:13,838
I am thrilled your boy...

255
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,275
can continue
to work here.

256
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:17,245
If you need a hat-check girl,
I've got a daughter.

257
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:19,942
Homer, you're
a hell of a father.

258
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,552
Homer! What did
you find out?

259
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,952
The only thing
going on down there...

260
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:27,284
was male bonding.

261
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,291
More stink lines, boys.

262
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,292
Hmm?

263
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:33,124
What are you boys doing?

264
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:37,226
You didn't see nothing.
Now, beat it.

265
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,696
So, Fat Tony,
you invite...

266
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:46,037
me and my associates
to your club...

267
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,337
with the promise...

268
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,038
of the finest Manhattans
in all of Springfield.

269
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:53,776
Now you say your bartender
isn't here?

270
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,249
I don't know
what happened.

271
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,252
Louie, make up
some Manhattans.

272
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,845
I only know how to make
wine spritzers.

273
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:00,855
Now!

274
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:12,362
What have I done to deserve
this flat, flavorless Manhattan?

275
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:18,868
Mmmmm...

276
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:22,167
Come on, boys.

277
00:13:23,747 --> 00:13:25,078
The kiss of death.

278
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:26,581
That's all I need.

279
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:32,287
...lousy Skinner.

280
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:34,289
<i>You are late for work.</i>

281
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:36,325
Of course
I'm late for work!

282
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:39,294
Principal Skinner
kept me after school.

283
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:40,886
Is Skinner causing you trouble?

284
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:42,488
<i>He sure is, patron.</i>

285
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:44,499
Hmm. Perhaps we should go...

286
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,899
to meet and greet
this individual.

287
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,232
Come on, boys.

288
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,640
Some large men
to see you, sir.

289
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:57,942
I don't have an appointment
with any large men.

290
00:13:58,014 --> 00:14:00,141
You Skinner?

291
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:02,446
I'm Principal Skinner, yes.

292
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,545
And how did you get past
the hall monitors?

293
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:14,588
Children, I don't know
how to break this to you...

294
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,791
but Principal Skinner is...

295
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,424
missing.

296
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:22,497
Uh-oh.

297
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,091
- [ Gasps ]
- What..?

298
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:36,428
Mm-mmm.

299
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:39,728
I thought I found him,
but it was only a cat.

300
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,606
- Chief Wiggum?
- Chief Wiggum?

301
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:49,107
Please, I assure you...

302
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:52,771
we'll be using the most advanced
scientific techniques...

303
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:54,279
in the field of...

304
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:55,406
body finding.

305
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,385
I see wedding bells...

306
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:02,615
for Vanna White
and Teddy Kennedy.

307
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:05,817
If we could just stick
to Principal Skinner.

308
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:09,294
Chief Wiggum, I am merely
a conduit for the spirits.

309
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:11,661
Willie Nelson
will astound his fans...

310
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:13,825
by swimming
the English Channel.

311
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:15,027
Really? Willie Nelson?

312
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:21,131
He loved fire drills.

313
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,642
Will you get a hold
of yourself, lass...

314
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,836
for the wee bairns.

315
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:26,573
Hey! Look at me!

316
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:27,841
I'm Skinner's body.

317
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,212
That is not funny.

318
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:31,751
I heard he's buried
under his parking spot.

319
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,753
I heard he was ground
into hamburger for lunch.

320
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,413
I heard Bart
had him killed.

321
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,752
That's just a rumor.

322
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:39,758
You're engaged in speculation.

323
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:40,815
I know the law.

324
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:42,486
You can't prove anything.

325
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,395
Wuhaa!

326
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:52,733
You killed me!

327
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:55,939
- Nuhh...
- Nuhh...

328
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:04,082
You killed me, Bart!

329
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:12,117
You k-k-killed me, B-Bart.

330
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:22,968
Reverend Lovejoy!

331
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:25,061
You've come
to comfort me?

332
00:16:25,138 --> 00:16:26,400
Yes, Bart.

333
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,236
There, there.

334
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:30,071
There, there.

335
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:35,743
Kill my boy.

336
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,044
Kill my boy.

337
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,720
There.

338
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,097
You're eight hours
early for work.

339
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:00,264
I like that.

340
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,932
Did you kill my principal?

341
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,840
Chinese guy with a moustache?

342
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,434
No. My principal.

343
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:06,774
That Skinner guy?

344
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,508
No, we didn't kill him.

345
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:10,277
You're all under arrest...

346
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,784
for the murder
of Seymour Skinner.

347
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:13,615
What's a murder?

348
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,621
Don't play dumb with me.

349
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:16,917
Cuff them, boys.

350
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:21,319
Oh, Bart.

351
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:24,125
Why couldn't you
have gotten a paper route...

352
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:25,221
like other boys?

353
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:26,959
Wait till I get you home.

354
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,228
Who's that guy?

355
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,734
Lionel Hutz, attorney.

356
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:32,294
I'll be defending you
on the charge of...

357
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:33,396
murder one!

358
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:35,532
Wow. Even if I lose
I'll be famous.

359
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,846
That Simpson boy
is looking at 1 80 years.

360
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:45,908
Thank God we live in a country
so hysterical over crime...

361
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:48,614
that a child can be tried
as an adult.

362
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,919
I didn't order
this guy killed.

363
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:53,084
Aren't you the head
of this gang?

364
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,923
No. I just stop by the club...

365
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:57,293
to read the complimentary
newspaper.

366
00:17:57,364 --> 00:18:00,765
<i>Then who is the kingpin,
the capo di tutti capi?</i>

367
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:01,960
That's the guy.

368
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,627
Hey!

369
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:05,968
Forgive me, Don Bartholomew.

370
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,634
We tried to stop the kid,
but he wouldn't quit.

371
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,611
Prostitution, loan sharking,
numbers...

372
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,137
The kid liked to wet his beak
in everything.

373
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:18,616
You've been his father
for ten years.

374
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:21,449
Do you really think
he could be the leader...

375
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:23,785
of a murderous
criminal syndicate?

376
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:25,324
Well, not the leader...

377
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,654
I mean...

378
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,888
Oh, it's true, it's true!

379
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:30,657
All the pieces fit.

380
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:37,063
In light
of the testimony...

381
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:39,332
from your gangsters,
your father...

382
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:41,271
your teachers and
a seemingly endless parade...

383
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:43,605
of emotionally shattered
baby-sitters...

384
00:18:43,677 --> 00:18:45,907
this court has
no choice but to...

385
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:47,003
Stop!

386
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,173
Principal Skinner!

387
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:50,511
I thought he was dead.

388
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:53,246
I suppose you're wondering
where I've been.

389
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,083
It all started a week ago.

390
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:56,247
I was at my desk...

391
00:18:56,323 --> 00:18:58,450
updating the school
dress codes...

392
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:00,789
<i>when I was confronted by toughs...</i>

393
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,762
<i>acting on behalf
of one Bart Simpson...</i>

394
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,127
<i>or so they said.</i>

395
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:07,098
We think the boy
has promise.

396
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,600
Get out!

397
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:12,126
<i>To get my mind
off that ugly confrontation...</i>

398
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:15,299
<i>I went home and began bundling
my old newspapers.</i>

399
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,808
<i>Suddenly the pile fell.</i>

400
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:18,139
<i>I was trapped.</i>

401
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,476
<i>Let this be a lesson
to recycle frequently.</i>

402
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:25,143
<i>I stayed alive
by eating my mother's preserves...</i>

403
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:26,776
<i>and maintained my sanity...</i>

404
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:29,048
<i>by dribbling
a nearby basketball.</i>

405
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:31,613
I made a game
of seeing how many times...

406
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:34,854
I could bounce the ball,
and breaking that record.

407
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:37,829
<i>The police arrived
to search my home.</i>

408
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,297
Find anything, boys?

409
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:40,458
No sign of him.

410
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:41,592
Princess Opal?

411
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:43,636
I'm afraid
it's splitsville...

412
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:45,796
for Delta Burke
and Major Dad.

413
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:47,499
They seemed so happy.

414
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:50,839
<i>I shouted until I was hoarse,
but they couldn't hear me.</i>

415
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,276
I'm in here!

416
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:54,279
Well, let's go.

417
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:55,507
Okay, Chief.

418
00:19:55,582 --> 00:19:58,016
<i>I realized
if I was ever getting out...</i>

419
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:59,642
<i>I had to do it myself.</i>

420
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:01,243
<i>I formed a crude rocket...</i>

421
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:02,515
<i>from a cigar tube.</i>

422
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:05,023
<i>Remembering an experiment
from my days...</i>

423
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:06,683
<i>as a science teacher...</i>

424
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,352
<i>I concocted a fuel...</i>

425
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:10,487
<i>from baking soda
and lemon juice.</i>

426
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:14,056
<i>The rocket took off with
a mighty blast of carbon dioxide...</i>

427
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:15,999
<i>dragging a vacuum cleaner
cord.</i>

428
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,969
<i>I grabbed the vacuum cleaner...</i>

429
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,836
<i>pushed the cord-retractor
button...</i>

430
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:23,398
<i>and was on my way to freedom.</i>

431
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,239
And that's my courageous story.

432
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:28,780
The prosecution moves...

433
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:31,977
that this testimony
be stricken from the record.

434
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:34,282
Denied. Case dismissed.

435
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:35,582
Your Honor...

436
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:37,885
uh, do I still get paid?

437
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,618
I hope there are
no hard feelings.

438
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,627
Get bent.

439
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:43,856
I deserve that.

440
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,626
I know we let you down,
but me and the boys...

441
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,134
we still think
you've got a big future...

442
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:51,193
in racketeering
and extortion.

443
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:53,796
I used to think
your gang was cool...

444
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,171
but now I learned...

445
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:57,005
that crime doesn't pay.

446
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:58,806
Yeah, you're right.

447
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:11,820
<i>Blood on the Blackboard::
The Bart Simpson Story...</i>

448
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:15,328
starring Richard Chamberlain
as Principal Skinner...

449
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:16,987
Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony...

450
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:19,327
Jane Seymour
as the woman he loved...

451
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:22,061
and Neil Patrick Harris
as Bart Simpson.

452
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:23,466
Let's get out of here.

453
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:24,594
Shut up.

454
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,764
Where do you want it, Skinner?

455
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:30,870
Not smart.

456
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:35,607
- Cool!
- When do we get the check for this?

457
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:37,445
They changed it
just enough...

458
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:39,451
so they don't have
to pay us.

459
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,987
You know who
the real crooks are--

460
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,216
those sleazy
Hollywood producers.

461
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:53,749
Shh!
