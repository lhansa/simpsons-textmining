1
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:07,494
<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:38,966
D'oh!

3
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:56,668
<i>Now, class...</i>

4
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:57,965
I promised you...

5
00:00:58,038 --> 00:00:59,596
a surprise today.

6
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:00,935
Wow!

7
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:06,645
I knew it.

8
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:07,941
And here it is.

9
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,710
We're going to take a test.

10
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:11,614
Oh!

11
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,915
We're going to take a test.

12
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,955
All right! A test!

13
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:19,720
It's called the Career Aptitude
Normalizing Test--

14
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:20,987
Or ''CAN'T.''

15
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:22,494
Some of you may discover...

16
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:24,621
a wonderful vocation
you never imagined.

17
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:26,893
Others may find out
life isn't fair.

18
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,629
In spite of your masters
from Bryn Mawr...

19
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:33,298
you might end up a baby-sitter
to dead-eyed fourth graders...

20
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:35,933
while your husband
runs naked on a beach...

21
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,978
with your marriage counselor!

22
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:41,976
First question--

23
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:44,984
''If I could be any animal,
I would be:

24
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:46,485
A) a carpenter ant...

25
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:47,986
B) a nurse shark...

26
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:50,046
or, C) a lawyer bird.''

27
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:52,582
Question 60--

28
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,593
''I prefer the smell of:

29
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,253
A) gasoline...

30
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,593
B) french fries...

31
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,724
or, C) bank customers.''

32
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:04,602
Well, that was
a waste of time.

33
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:07,265
Janie, school is never
a waste of time.

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,399
Since we have 1 5 minutes
until recess...

35
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:10,909
please put down your pencils...

36
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:13,275
and stare
at the front of the room.

37
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,176
Here for the tests.

38
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,313
Come on, Emma.

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,212
<i>Here's your
scientifically selected career.</i>

40
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:57,415
Architect!

41
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,549
Mm-hmm.

42
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,252
Insurance salesman.

43
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:01,385
Mm-hmm.

44
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:03,190
Salmon gutter?!

45
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:05,288
Military strongman!

46
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,266
Systems analyst,systems analyst,
systems analyst.

47
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,267
Systems analyst.

48
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:10,735
All right!

49
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,499
Homemaker?

50
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,130
Mm-hmm. It's like a mommy.

51
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,265
Police officer?!

52
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:16,934
Well, I'll be jiggered.

53
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,478
If you'd like
to learn more...

54
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:20,604
I could arrange...

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,580
a ride-along
in a police car.

56
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:25,209
<i>I don't need you to get me
in a police car.</i>

57
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:26,752
You should consider this.

58
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,415
Before I saw these test results,
I had you pegged a drifter.

59
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,152
Wow. A drifter.

60
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:34,784
Lousy sheriff.

61
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,954
<i>Run me out of town.</i>

62
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,622
He's lost my vote.

63
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,497
Cool.

64
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,002
<i>A homemaker.!</i>

65
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,163
I might as well be dead.

66
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,501
It's not that bad.

67
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:48,836
What will you be, boy?

68
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:49,841
Policeman.

69
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,239
Oh, that's nice.

70
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,576
Your father
wanted to be a policeman...

71
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,912
but they said
he was too heavy.

72
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,247
The army said
I was too heavy.

73
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,514
The police said
I was too dumb.

74
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:04,079
I'm going to be
a famous jazz musician.

75
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:06,591
I'll be unappreciated
in my own country...

76
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,595
but my gutsy blues stylings
will electrify the French.

77
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:10,925
I'll avoid drug abuse...

78
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,591
but have several
torrid love affairs...

79
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,931
and I may or may not die young.

80
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:17,230
I haven't decided.

81
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,966
Honey, if that's what you want,
we'll help.

82
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,268
Wait a minute.

83
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,606
Isn't anybody gonna
follow in my footsteps?

84
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,479
<i>Tell me
if I have what it takes...</i>

85
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,615
to be a blues musician.

86
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,887
Show me your chops.

87
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,625
Uh-huh.

88
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:49,300
Yeah.

89
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:58,235
Cool.

90
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,404
So, you think
she has talent?

91
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,572
Sure.

92
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:03,878
Do you think
she could be a professional?

93
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,212
Oh, Lord, no.

94
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:07,253
But I'll practice every day.

95
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,548
I'll be frank
with you.

96
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,715
When I say frank,
I mean devastating.

97
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,849
You've inherited
a finger condition...

98
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,359
known as stubbiness.

99
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:15,485
It usually comes...

100
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,257
<i>from the father's side.</i>

101
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,592
D'oh!

102
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:19,859
Stupid fingers.

103
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,901
You're wrong! You're wrong!

104
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:25,096
You don't need long fingers
to play the blues.

105
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,264
The blues come from in here.

106
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,570
My God, they are stubby.

107
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,110
I didn't steal
that copper wire.

108
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,580
I just thought
they were throwing it out.

109
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,708
Here. Take it.

110
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:39,615
No. We're here
for your son.

111
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,347
He's coming
on a ride-along.

112
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:44,117
Maybe this
will straighten the boy out.

113
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,785
Wow! Can I see your club?

114
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,158
It's called a baton,
son.

115
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:50,161
What's it for?

116
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,492
We club people...

117
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:52,690
<i>with it.</i>

118
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,166
Well! It's about time.

119
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,759
<i>So you guys...</i>

120
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,394
like being cops?

121
00:05:58,471 --> 00:05:59,665
Oh, it's great.

122
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:02,105
You run red lights,
park wherever you please...

123
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,109
hot-and-cold-running chicks.

124
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:06,407
And when
you go home at night...

125
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,106
you know
you've made a difference.

126
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:09,273
See that Caddie?

127
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,407
Uh-huh.

128
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:11,882
That's Mayor Quimby's car.

129
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:15,285
Tonight his honor is...
polling the electorate.

130
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:18,722
How would you like
a street named after you?

131
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,265
I tell you.

132
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,359
They only come out at night.

133
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:30,596
<i>Dear log...</i>

134
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,865
<i>this will be my last entry...</i>

135
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,602
<i>for you were a journal
of my hopes and dreams...</i>

136
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,610
<i>and now, I have none.</i>

137
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,217
Do you need straight A's
to be a cop?

138
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,286
Hey, fellas,
let's go shoot some bad guys.

139
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,455
It doesn't quite
work that way, son.

140
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,897
<i>People see movies like McBain,
and they think it's all...</i>

141
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,367
bang-bang, shoot-'em-up
cops and robbers.

142
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:05,336
Let's roll.

143
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:07,904
One-Ocean-Tango.

144
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:10,238
We're in pursuit
of a speeding individual...

145
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,710
driving a red... car,
license number...

146
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,043
Eggplant-Xerxes-
Crybaby-Overbite-Narwhal.

147
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,242
Oh, no.

148
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,511
Cops.

149
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:24,756
Whoo. They used
nylon rope this time.

150
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,088
It feels so smooth
my skin--

151
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,151
almost sensuous.

152
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,933
Ooh, baby.

153
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,076
Damn boxes.

154
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,846
He's trapped.

155
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,891
Where's our backup?
I don't know.

156
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:08,456
Son, this is against
every regulation...

157
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,093
but would you cover us?

158
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,102
Wow!

159
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:19,410
Huh?

160
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:29,618
See you in hell, punk.

161
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:41,414
See you in hell, punk!

162
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:50,214
Man, that was close.

163
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,418
Good thing this alley
got so narrow in the middle.

164
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,029
Well, that's nice work, boys.

165
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:00,362
Looks like
you just bought yourself...

166
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:02,230
a lottery ticket--
to jail.

167
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:03,769
He's unconscious, sir.

168
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,862
Oh, they can
still hear things.

169
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,065
Sir, I know...

170
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,041
what I want to be
when I grow up-- a cop.

171
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,270
Until then, son...

172
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm making you
an honorary police officer.

173
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,308
Eddie, give him...

174
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:16,314
your badge.

175
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:17,008
Hey!

176
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,210
Morning, honey.

177
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:22,276
What's so good...

178
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,152
about being stuck
in the house...

179
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:25,282
behind a stove?

180
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:27,792
Lisa, I know
you're down on homemaking...

181
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:30,261
but it can really
let you be creative.

182
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,527
See? This morning
I turned bacon, eggs, and toast...

183
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,864
into a smiley face
for Bart and Homer.

184
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,960
What's the point?
They'll never notice.

185
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,403
Oh, well,
you'd surprised.

186
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,837
Hmm, umm, hmm...

187
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,646
Now just relax your hand.

188
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,244
Thank you, ma'am.

189
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:57,255
You've been most cooperative.

190
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:03,894
Bad dog!

191
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:06,158
Very bad dog!

192
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,063
Mom, before
you blame the dog...

193
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:10,830
take a look at these
surveillance photos.

194
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,428
Oh.

195
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:13,767
Oh!

196
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:17,635
Oh, Bart!

197
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,042
I don't know how
that got in there.

198
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:23,378
Lisa, why aren't you
at band practice?

199
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,382
I quit.

200
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,316
Right now
you're discouraged...

201
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:28,718
but you know
you love the saxophone.

202
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:31,154
I think you should stay
in the band.

203
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:34,921
<i>If you think it's so great,
why don't you join the band?</i>

204
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:35,926
Lisa!

205
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:37,360
People like to tell you...

206
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,761
what you can't do...

207
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:42,097
but they don't always know
what they're talking about.

208
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:46,397
You know what
I want to be?

209
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:48,839
The girl
on the oatmeal box?

210
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:53,407
No. I'm going to be
an astronaut.

211
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,311
Women can't be astronauts.

212
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,075
Why not?

213
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:57,411
They distract the men...

214
00:10:57,484 --> 00:11:00,419
so they wouldn't keep
their minds on the road.

215
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,580
There will be
women astronauts.

216
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:04,588
It's true...

217
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:06,090
and we'll all live...

218
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,649
in cities on the moon.

219
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,355
So, you see,
my sisters were wrong--

220
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,331
except about
the cities on the moon.

221
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,765
I was wrong about that, so--

222
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:19,271
Well, you can see
how anyone can be wrong.

223
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:23,941
Sleek, vigilant puma--

224
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,274
principal of the mountains.

225
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:29,375
Hi, Lis.

226
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:31,349
Want to quiz me
on the vowels?

227
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,885
I'm ready to chuck
the whole alphabet.

228
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:34,544
Huh?

229
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:40,892
Lisa, what
are you doing?

230
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,951
That's a bad-girl bathroom!

231
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:44,394
Duh!

232
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:47,561
You want to egg...

233
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:48,794
Skinner's car?

234
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,301
Okay.

235
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,837
What are you
looking at?

236
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:52,530
Nothing.

237
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:53,572
Then get out.

238
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,040
We're figuring out
stuff to egg.

239
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:59,510
Okay, but if you really
want to honk Skinner off...

240
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,945
I suggest you attack
the one thing...

241
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,506
he truly believes in.

242
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:06,643
I saw some awful things in 'Nam...

243
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:09,745
but you really have to wonder
at the mentality...

244
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:12,222
that would desecrate
a helpless puma.

245
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,157
I never thought I'd say this...

246
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:16,661
but the no-goodniks
rule this school.

247
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:19,323
<i>Get your hands off me.!</i>

248
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,697
God, I could really use
a half day.

249
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:24,532
Think you're big men
with your handcuffs...

250
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:25,593
and blasted Tasers!

251
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:27,105
Get him out of here.

252
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:30,700
I'll get you, Bart Simpson,
if it's the last thing I do!

253
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,210
What is this all about?

254
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,836
It's quite simple,
really.

255
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:36,711
I observed our friend,
Groundskeeper Willie, burning leaves--

256
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:39,377
a blatant disregard
for our clean air laws.

257
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:42,444
Bart Simpson on the side
of law and order?!

258
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:44,717
Has the world gone topsy-turvy?

259
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,951
That's right, man.

260
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:48,220
I got my first taste
of authority...

261
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:49,784
and I liked it.

262
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:51,386
Hmm.

263
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:53,659
There are a lot
of troublemakers...

264
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:54,722
in this school...

265
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:57,065
and I can't be everywhere
at once.

266
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:58,569
Go on.

267
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,629
Look, let's can
the euphemisms.

268
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:03,232
How would you like
to be a hall monitor?

269
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:05,402
Wouldn't that mean
squealing on other kids?

270
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:06,877
That's the meat of it.

271
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:08,243
Hmm.

272
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:11,177
Now, Witness X...

273
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,048
would you please tell the court
what you saw?

274
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,917
I'd be more
than happy to.

275
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:17,581
I saw Mr. Montone there...

276
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,625
seal Mr. Palaccio
in an oil drum...

277
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:21,717
and roll him
off the pier.

278
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:22,954
I kill you!

279
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,497
<i>Ay, caramba.!</i>

280
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:27,032
I don't know.

281
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,398
Oh, now,
you get to wear a sash.

282
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,070
You got yourself a narc.

283
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:35,869
Hey,Jimbo,
keeping your nose clean, dude?

284
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:38,035
Hey, Donna,
who loves you, baby?

285
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,747
Not in my hall, bub.

286
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,680
I think you've had enough,
sister.

287
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,721
Come on,
let's keep it moving.

288
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:50,756
Pink belly! Pink belly!

289
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:51,755
Pink belly!

290
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:52,950
Break it up, boys.

291
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:55,688
That belly ain't going
to get any pinker.

292
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:56,694
Wedgie!

293
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,224
Thanks, Bart.

294
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:07,971
Bart's grades
are up a little this term...

295
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,906
but Lisa's are way down.

296
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:13,912
Oh, we always have one good kid
and one lousy kid.

297
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,039
Why can't both our kids
be good?

298
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:18,106
We have three kids,
Homer.

299
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:21,847
Marge, the dog doesn't count
as a kid.

300
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:23,684
No. Maggie.

301
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:24,848
Oh, yeah.

302
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:27,859
Now take some paste
and spread it...

303
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:29,690
on the construction paper.

304
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:31,957
Ralph, are you eating
your paste?

305
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:33,692
No, Miss Hoover.

306
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:37,133
Good. Now sprinkle your sparkles
on your paste.

307
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:40,138
Lisa, you're not sprinkling
your sparkles.

308
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,070
Shove it.

309
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:43,235
I have never seen...

310
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:45,573
a good student
take such a slide.

311
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:46,907
Lisa, what are you...

312
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,503
rebelling against?

313
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,071
What do you got?

314
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:57,378
<i>...and she goes...</i>

315
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:58,441
''Lisa told Hoover
to shove it.''

316
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,045
And I'm, like,
''No way--''

317
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:03,056
Hey, Lisa, man.

318
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:04,751
I'm, like, so impressed.

319
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:08,353
When I was in second grade,
I was all ''I'm so good.''

320
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,362
Want a smoke?

321
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:14,368
Uh... I'll smoke it in class.

322
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,028
Whoa!
Whoa!

323
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:18,265
Bart, you're doing
a bang-up job.

324
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,900
There were some corridors
in this school...

325
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,204
you'd never go down.

326
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:23,767
Now I feel safe anywhere.

327
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,710
Every day
is a new fight, sir.

328
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,044
Bart, the school
is a police state.

329
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:30,050
Students are afraid
to sneeze.

330
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:31,585
I have you to thank.

331
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,587
Come with me.

332
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:35,987
<i>Madre de Dios.!</i>

333
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:38,457
The legends were true!

334
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:41,222
Whenever a teacher
confiscates something...

335
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:42,285
it ends up here.

336
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,695
Salacious halter tops...

337
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:46,256
<i>complete collections
of Mad, Cracked...</i>

338
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,529
<i>and the occasional issue
of Crazy...</i>

339
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:50,537
and this plastic derriere.

340
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,532
Now, to show my gratitude,
I want you...

341
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,579
to help yourself
to an item of your choice.

342
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,678
All right!

343
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,184
You be careful
with that crossbow.

344
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:05,446
I will.

345
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,725
This is an absence slip...

346
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,459
signed by Nelson's mother...

347
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,024
and this
is Nelson's English homework.

348
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:24,299
Notice the identical
elongated loops on the D's.

349
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:28,138
<i>Forgery!
So he didn't have leprosy.</i>

350
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:34,981
I thought
I could never teach again.

351
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,347
Things have changed.

352
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:40,548
There will be no mockery
of your name, Mr. Glasscock.

353
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:51,891
Hey, Louis, watch this.

354
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,401
Ow! Bart, do something!

355
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:56,164
Let's go, Milhouse.

356
00:16:56,237 --> 00:17:00,037
Sure, we have order. But at what price?

357
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,075
Now let's correct
our homework exercises.

358
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:09,515
Lisa, what 1 9th-century figure
was nicknamed ''Old Hickory''?

359
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:11,677
I don't know. You?

360
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:15,956
Lisa, if you'd bothered
to do the assignment...

361
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:18,492
you'd know the answer is...

362
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,858
the Battle of New Orleans.

363
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:23,454
I mean... Andrew Jackson.

364
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:26,523
Well, you're earning
your 1 8 grand a year.

365
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,672
Stupid Hoover.

366
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:34,675
Thinks she's so smart.

367
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:38,679
She wouldn't be so smart
without her teacher's edition.

368
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,429
Uh, ladies and gentlemen...

369
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:06,406
the unthinkable has happened.

370
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:08,840
Some sick, twisted individual
has stolen...

371
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,606
every teacher's edition
in this school.

372
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,611
What do we do?

373
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,806
Does anyone know...

374
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:15,577
the multiplication table?

375
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,117
Please, don't panic.

376
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:19,982
They can smell fear.

377
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,523
Children,
for rest of day...

378
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,285
Martin
will be teaching...

379
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,348
this class.

380
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:27,952
But I wouldn't know
where to begin.

381
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:29,121
Do it, brainiac.

382
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:32,166
Have I ever told you kids
about the '60s?

383
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,966
I've got to get out of here.

384
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,407
Calm blue ocean,
calm blue ocean.

385
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:44,968
Calm blue ocean,
calm blue ocean.

386
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:46,673
I'm leaving again.

387
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:49,012
Mr. Glasscock,
please reconsider.

388
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,517
Uh-uh.

389
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:56,212
Bart, the police
haven't had any luck...

390
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,316
finding
the teacher's editions.

391
00:18:58,393 --> 00:18:59,655
The dogs...

392
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:02,389
have picked up
the scent of books.

393
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:04,159
Send in
the battering ram.

394
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:06,166
Here we go.

395
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:09,463
We'll have to reorder
every book.

396
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:11,334
Seymour,
I'll bet you...

397
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:13,169
those books are still here.

398
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:15,505
We have to search every locker.

399
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:16,601
Locker searches...

400
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:18,737
aren't permitted
by the Supreme Court.

401
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:19,780
Supreme Court.

402
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:21,713
What have they done
for us lately?

403
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:22,545
Let's move.

404
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:35,421
Hmm.

405
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,096
Baa!

406
00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:10,896
Lisa!

407
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,091
That's right.

408
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,657
It was I.

409
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:15,726
Lis, why did you do it?

410
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:16,735
Come on, Bart!

411
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:18,328
In your pre-fascist days...

412
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:20,931
you knew the thrill
of futile rebellion.

413
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,136
Yeah, but even I
had my limits.

414
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:26,203
You're looking
at expulsion for this.

415
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:27,805
I know! I know!

416
00:20:33,488 --> 00:20:34,955
The books!

417
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:38,288
Oh, answers! Answers!

418
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,728
Simpson, you've just saved
this school $1 20.

419
00:20:42,797 --> 00:20:46,460
Who's behind
this monstrous crime?

420
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:47,466
I am.

421
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:51,164
<i>I've been blind.</i>

422
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:54,697
The signs all pointed
to a rogue hall monitor.

423
00:20:54,776 --> 00:20:57,609
Sorry I betrayed your trust,
Principal ''Sucker.''

424
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,705
In light of your recent service
to the school...

425
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,716
I've decided to be lenient.

426
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,376
400 days detention.

427
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:05,419
400 days.

428
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:07,477
I can do that
standing on my head.

429
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,216
All right, 500 days.

430
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,814
Ooh! Big man!

431
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:12,223
600 days.

432
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,761
Maybe I'll just
shut my big mouth.

433
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:17,195
Let's go, Simpson.

434
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:19,563
Bart, why did you
take the blame?

435
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:22,569
'Cause I didn't want you
to wreck your life.

436
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:25,538
You got the brains and talent
to go as far as you want...

437
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:26,835
and when you do...

438
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,274
I'll be right there
to borrow money.

439
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:30,868
Oh, Bart.

440
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,415
Sounding good, Lis.

441
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:55,290
Shh!
