00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,392
D'oh!

3
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:27,933
Look, Dad, there's a spot.

4
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:29,873
- D'oh!
- There's a spot, dear.

5
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:34,803
D'oh! Oh, there's a good one.

6
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:38,009
That spot says ''compact only.''

7
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:40,815
Marge, that's just
a suggested car size.

8
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:48,190
Easy. Easy. How am I
doin' on the right?

9
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:50,856
We're getting
a lot of sparks here, Dad.

10
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,024
Uh-huh. Easy.

11
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,965
Easy.

12
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:58,835
Perfect. All right, everybody,
out the window.

13
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:00,668
They all look great.

14
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,538
What are we going to see?

15
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:03,769

00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,941
<i>Look Who's Oinking.!</i>

18
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:10,211
Since we'll never agree,
why don't you kids pick a movie...

19
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:13,344
your dad and I will pick one,
then we'll all meet in the lobby later.

20
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,388
Thanks, Mom.

21
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:18,322
<i>- Two tickets for--
- Let me guess. Look Who's Oinking.</i>

22
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:20,485
- That's right.
- Sold out.

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,051
Maybe we could see something
a little more adult.

24
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,463
Why, Marge, you frisky little devil.
[ Sexy Growl ]

25
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,934
<i>We'll take two tickets
to The Stockholm Affair.</i>

26
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:33,666
Ooh. The paper called it
a taut political thriller.

27
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,004
Political?

28
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:37,634
Mr. President, disturbing news.

29
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,908
Serious cracks are developing
in the Greco-Bolivian alliance.

30
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:43,074
Get meJed Colic!

31
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,964
Oh, this movie's
too complicated.

32
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:05,994
Hey, the floor's sticky.

33
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:09,531
Who's that guy? What did that guy say
when I said, ''Who's that guy?''

34
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:14,371
Oh, that submarine is so fake.

35
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:17,815
Look, you can see the strings.
Ooh! An octopus!

36
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:19,943
- Shh!
- What?

37
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,796
If you don't watch the violence,
you'll never get desensitized to it.

38
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:32,297
Just tell me when
the scary part's over.

39
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,334
<i>- It's over.</i>

40
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,201
- I think that guy's a spy.
- Of course he's a spy.

41
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:42,764
You just saw him go
through spy school.

42
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:45,641
Oh, wait.
I heard how this ends.

43
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:49,671
Turns out the secret code was the same
nursery rhyme he told his daughter.

44
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,780
It's pretty obvious
if you think about it.

45
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:57,051
Shut up, Homer!
No one wants to hear what you think!

46
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:59,058
Yeah!

47
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:06,264
Homer, if it makes
you feel any better...

48
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,665
most of what they threw at you
splattered on me.

49
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,498
Homer?

50
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,561
Forget it, Mom.
Dad's really mad.

51
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,698
His tendons are throbbing.

52
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,743
Stress is collecting
in the trouble spots--

53
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,042
here, here, and here--
making for one unhappy pappy.

54
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:25,043
Homie, aren't you coming inside?

55
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:27,211
Marge, I have always
carried myself...

56
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:28,982
with a certain quiet dignity.

57
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,285
Tonight, you robbed me of it.

58
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:35,658
I'm going now, and I don't know
when you'll see me again.

59
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:45,904
I guess that executive stress ball
we got him isn't working.

60
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,609
Mmm.

61
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,658
Eww, a skunk.

62
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:29,982
Oh, no!

63
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,214
- Ooh, a redneck bar.

64
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,482
Hey, you, let's fight.

65
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,493
Them's fightin' words.

66
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:44,087
Duff, please.

67
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:47,565
We don't sell Duff.
We sell Fudd.

68
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:50,068
Okay, Fudd me.

69
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:52,036
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen...

70
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:54,039
he's all healed up
and back for more.

71
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:57,338
Let's give a big drunken welcome
to Yodeling Zeke.

74
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:04,609
# Odel-lay-hee #

75
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:15,193
Our next act is our very own
singing waitress-- Lurleen.

76
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:20,825
So I'm afraid drink service
will stop for a moment--

77
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:24,567
They're all yours.

78
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:27,072
<i>Stupid Marge.
Tell me to shut up.</i>

79
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,906
Thank you. Tonight I'd like to
try something different.

80
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:34,469
It's a song I wrote while I was
mopping up your dried blood and teeth.

81
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:40,643
#You work all day
for some old man #

82
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,780
- # Sweat and break your back #
- Yeah.

83
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,655
#Then you go home
to your castle #

84
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:49,752
# But your queen
won't cut you slack #

85
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,091
That's true.

86
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:53,928
#That's why you're losing
all your hair #

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,594
- #That's why you're overweight #
- Uh-huh.

88
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,106
#That's why you flipped
your pickup truck #

89
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,107
# Right off the interstate #

90
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:04,643
That's right,
except for the truck.

91
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,839
#There's a lot of bull
they hand you #

92
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:11,281
#There's nothing you can do #

93
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:14,445
#Your wife don't understand you #

94
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:17,285
# But I do #

95
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:20,815
# No, your wife
don't understand you #

96
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:23,624
# But I do #

97
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:26,791
# I said,
no one understands you #

98
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:30,700
# But I do ##

99
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,607
Hey, Lurleen? I gotta
say something to you.

100
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,481
- I'm listening.
- Your song touched me in a way
I've never felt before.

101
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:48,180
And which way to the can?

102
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:54,725
- So, what's your name, stranger?
- HomerJ. Simpson.

103
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:56,288
I'm Lurleen Lumpkin.

104
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,562
- That's a pretty name.
- You think so?

105
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:01,730
Maybe. I'm not sure.

106
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:03,204
I forgot it.

107
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,206
Bye, Lurleen.

108
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,140
So long, HomerJ. Simpson.

109
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,041
Hello.

110
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,051
Where were you all night?

111
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,053
I was at this bar
in Spittle County.

112
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,021
You should have called.
I was worried.

113
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:23,685
Let's end this feudin' and a-fussin'
and get down to some lovin'.

114
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,456
<i>##I work all day ##</i>

115
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:38,333
Doctor, you weren't supposed
to remove his gall bladder.

116
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,842
Put it back!
Put it back!

117
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,344
<i>## Your wife don't understand you ##</i>

118
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:44,506
# But I do #

119
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,049
Gee, Homer's singing
to his ball again.

120
00:08:47,117 --> 00:08:49,642
- He's bowling a 280.
- Oh, yeah?

121
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:54,183
#There's a kind of hush #

122
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:58,695
#All over the world tonight #

123
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,830
Moe, you got any Fudd?

124
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:06,165
Fudd? They took that off the market
after all those hillbillies went blind.

125
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:09,000
No-- I went to this bar
the other night and--

126
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:11,541
Wait a minute.
You went to another bar?

127
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:14,202
Moe, I was 1 00 miles
out of town.

128
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,109
Oh, Homer.

129
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,188
Well, if it isn't
HomerJ. Simpson.

130
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:30,692
I can't get your song
out of my mind.

131
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,854
I haven't felt this way
since ''Funkytown.''

132
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,864
Aren't you sweet.

133
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,263
Can I get a copy of it?

134
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,597
Sorry, darling.
All my songs are up here--

135
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:41,263
''I'm Basting a Turkey
With My Tears''...

136
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:43,602
''Don't Look Up My Dress
Unless You Mean It''...

137
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:46,268
''I'm Sick of Your Lying Lips
and False Teeth.''

138
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:50,109
We've got to crack open your head
and scoop out those songs.

139
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,444
- I don't know.
- Come with me.

140
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,886
# I said no one understands you #

141
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:01,721
# But I do #

142
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:07,023
Listen, ma'am.

143
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:10,396
My brother owns a radio station
in Weevilville...

144
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:13,231
and I'd like to take
your C.D. to him.

145
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:16,067
Homer, it's your quarter.
What do you say?

146
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,440
I guess so.

147
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:23,378
<i>This is KUDD 570 AM.</i>

148
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:26,473
Don't touch that dial.
You've got KUDD on it.

149
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,781
#You work all day for some old man #

150
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:32,014
# Sweat and break your back #

151
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,751
For the next half hour,
beer's on the house.

152
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:36,884
- What did you say, Moe?
- Nothing.

153
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,760
I thought I told you
to stay away from my sister!

154
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:43,732
# But your queen
won't cut you slack #

155
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:47,362
Oh, here's 50 bucks.
Take her to the Copa.

156
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,703
# Now you talk so tough
and act so rough #

157
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:53,709
It's payback time.

158
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:57,042
#The heartache and the sadness #

159
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,878
#That's buried deep inside #

160
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,383
Aww.

161
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,785
Puts this whole riot
into perspective, doesn't it?

162
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:10,293
# No one understands you,
but I do #

163
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,294
She's wonderful.

164
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:15,957
I could feel her country soul
in every digitally encoded bit.

165
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,898
Country music sucks.

166
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,165
It takes precious air space
from shock deejays...

167
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,536
whose cruelty and profanity
amuse us all.

168
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:26,371
Shut up, boy.
Marge, what do you think?

169
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:28,968
It's nice,
but who is this woman?

170
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:31,173
Right now she's an out-of-work
cocktail waitress...

171
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:34,046
but she's going to be
a country music superstar...

172
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:38,577
like that jerk in the cowboy hat
and that dead lady.

173
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:41,385
I don't like you
hanging around some waitress.

174
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,120
You make it sound so seamy.

175
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,719
All I did was spend
the afternoon in her trailer...

176
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:48,731
watching her try on some outfits.

177
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,600
Hi, Lurleen.
We were just talking about you.

178
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:57,299
I think I can come over.
Let me ask my wife.

179
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,509
It's a date.

180
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,244
Oh, Homer.

181
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:07,806
Everybody's been calling--

182
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:09,944
Mama, Daddy, the triplets...

183
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,080
Vonda Mae, PineyJoe--

184
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:15,249
and I owe it all to you.

185
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:16,417
Don't thank me.

186
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:18,757
You should be thanking
your brain.

187
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:19,955
Oh, Homer.

188
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,999
No man has ever been
this nice to me without...

189
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:26,263
you know,
wanting something in return.

190
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:29,828
I was gonna ask for some water,
but now I feel guilty about it.

191
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:33,843
Homer, you're just
a big sack of sugar.

192
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:37,347
- Thanks. You did say ''sugar,'' right?
- Uh-huh.

193
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:41,077
Now, Homer,
I want you to be my manager.

194
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:44,120
Really? I should warn you,
I'm not great with figures.

195
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:46,155
- That's okay.
- I make stupid decisions.

196
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,191
- Nobody's perfect.
- I did bad in school.

197
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,852
- I didn't even go.
- My personal hygiene
has been described as--

198
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:53,920
Homer, Homer,
you'll be a great manager.

199
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:55,624
There's only one thing you need.

200
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,963
<i>This is made from
a space-age fabric...</i>

201
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,731
developed especially for Elvis.

202
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:04,171
Sweat actually cleans this suit.

203
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,674
Hmm.

204
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:13,010
Marge, look at me.

205
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,313
I don't want to.
I'm mad at you.

206
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:17,717
I'm sick of that waitress...

207
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:19,847
and this whole country music thing.

208
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,686
<i>Then you'd better not look at me.</i>

209
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,527
Homer, where did you get that suit?

210
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,757
A friend bought it for me.

211
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:29,355
Was it Lurleen?

212
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,264
No. I think it was Lenny.

213
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:32,597
Don't lie to me.

214
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:34,933
- Are you having an affair?
- No!

215
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:36,199
- Have you kissed her?
- No!

216
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,002
- Has she kissed you?
- Couple of times.

217
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:40,009
I want you to stop seeing her.

218
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:41,772
I can't.
I'm her manager.

219
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,506
Her manager!
That's ridiculous.

220
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,777
I won't allow you to spend
any more time away from your family.

221
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,284
You're standing in the way
of my boyhood dream...

222
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:51,253
of managing
a beautiful country singer!

223
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:54,119
Your boyhood dream was to eat
the world's biggest hoagie.

224
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:58,184
You did it at the county fair
last year, remember?

225
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:01,321
Lurleen will be a big success,
and I'll be there.

226
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:03,195
Fine. See if I care!

227
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,370
<i>[ Man ]
This studio has history.</i>

228
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,804
Buddy Holly stood here
in 1 958 and said...

229
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:20,071
''There is no way in hell
I'll record in this dump.''

230
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:22,806
I'm sure Lurleen will love it.

231
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,814
How much did you
just give that man?

232
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:27,316
Calm down, Marge.
Just our life savings.

233
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:29,318
I'm not going into hock for this.

234
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:31,320
Hey, Colonel Homer.

235
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:33,481
And you must be--

236
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:36,492
- Mrs. Homer Simpson.
- Charmed.

237
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,290
I thought you said
she was overweight.

238
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:42,730
It takes two to lie--
one to lie and one to listen.

239
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,131
What does that mean?

240
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:46,328
I don't have time to answer that.

241
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:48,735
Time is money.
Come on, people.

242
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,969
Well, come on, boys.
Let's break some hearts.

243
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:58,978
# Oh, the bases were empty
on the diamond of my heart #

244
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,984
#When the coach called me up
to the plate #

245
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,282
# I'd been swingin' and missin' #

246
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:05,583
#At lovin' and kissin' #

247
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,648
# My average was
point double-0 eight #

248
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:10,717
# So I spit on my hands #

249
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,318
# Knockin' dirt from my spikes #

250
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:15,490
#And pointed
right towards center field #

251
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,797
#This time I'm hittin'
a home run #

252
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,861
#This time love is for real #

253
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:24,203
Hey, Dad, can I do a hambone solo?

254
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:26,802
Stop it.

255
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:28,208
# ...for you #

256
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:29,870
# I been slumpin' all season #

257
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,505
# But now I found a reason #

258
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:34,847
# I struck on a love
that is true #

259
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,546
# I used to play the field #

260
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:40,852
# I used to be a roamer #

261
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:44,155
# But season's turnin' around
for me now #

262
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:47,527
# I finally bagged me a Homer #

263
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:48,622
That's right.

264
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,133
# I finally bagged me a Homer ##

265
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,567
Lurleen, we'll have to cut you off.

266
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:56,572
We're getting a grinding noise
on the track.

267
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,520
<i>You, off the bench.</i>

268
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,663
Guess what, Lurleen.
I got you a gig on TV.

269
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,169
Oh, Homer, you're as smart
as you are handsome.

270
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,966
Hey! Oh, you meant that
as a compliment.

271
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,031
Now, on this show they want you
to sing two songs.

272
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,339
Maybe we should give them
something new.

273
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:38,507
Well, I have been working on something
that could really heat things up.

274
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,049
Let's hear it.

275
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:44,420
# In this trailer #

276
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:49,858
# I get so cold and lonely #

277
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,522
# Lyin' there awake at night #

278
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,624
# Muttering, ''If only
you weren't married'' #

279
00:16:57,701 --> 00:17:00,693
# So I might ask you to #

280
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:04,036
# Bunk with me tonight #

281
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,235
# Bunk with me tonight #

282
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,973
# Oh, bunk with me tonight #

283
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:13,813
# I'm asking will you
bunk with me #

284
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:18,218
#Tonight ##

285
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,552
Oh, that's hot.

286
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,253
There isn't a man alive
who wouldn't get turned on by that.

287
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,556
Well, good-bye.

288
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,292
Uh, Homer, there's a hidden
message to this song...

289
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,391
that you may have missed.

290
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,958
Really listen.

291
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:37,234
# Bunk with me tonight #

292
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,674
- Uh-huh.
- # Bunk with me #

293
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,507
#Tonight #

294
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:45,047
- Right.
- # I'm asking #

295
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:47,640
<i>#Will you bunk #</i>

296
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:52,849
<i>#With me tonight ##</i>

297
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:57,189
- Lurleen!
- That's right, HomerJ.

298
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:58,990
I gotta think about this.

299
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,960
<i>All our money's tied up in this woman.</i>

300
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:06,298
If she fails, we're broke.

301
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,565
If she succeeds,
I have no husband.

302
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,630
I don't know what to root for.

303
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:13,175
- You don't?
- I gotta go.

304
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:15,711
- Homer?
- Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight.

305
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,747
I gotta get ready.

306
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:26,446
Just so you know, while you
and Lurleen were out judging
that greased pig contest...

307
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,252
Maggie got her first tooth.

308
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:31,317
That's great, honey.
Have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?

309
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:33,363
You're not even listening to me.

310
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,920
Sure they will.

311
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:38,161
Kids, will you come in here?

312
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:41,932
You've got a wonderful family, Homer.

313
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:45,099
Please don't forget it when
you walk out that door tonight.

314
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:47,609
Uh, I gotta go.

315
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:50,044
As much as I hate
that man right now...

316
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:52,081
you got to love that suit.

317
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:54,447
Hold on to your pitchforks,
everybody.

318
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:58,579
<i>It's time again for Ya Hoo.!</i>

319

327
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:25,342
# Oh, the bases were empty #

328
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,679
Excuse me, are you
Colonel Homer Simpson?

329
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,243
- Yes, I am.
- I'm from Rebel Yell Records.

330
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,256
- I'm interested in buying
Lurleen's contract.
- Forget it, pal.

331
00:19:34,324 --> 00:19:38,556
They don't call me Colonel Homer
because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.

332
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:41,654
Lurleen, they loved you.

333
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:45,168
I'm still a little itchy
from that fiberglass hay.

334
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:47,100
Is there anything you need?

335
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:53,399
Well, you could make
my evening complete.

336
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:57,103
What's wrong?

337
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,172
My whole romantic life
is flashing before my eyes.

338
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:03,778
- Gross!

339
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:07,489
Thanks for dinner.

340
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:08,990
Ow!

341
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:11,726
No!

342
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,695
At least, could I have my dollar--

343
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,790
I'll love you
for the rest of my life.

344
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:22,696
I'm sorry, Lurleen.

345
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:25,105
All I wanted to do was share
your beautiful voice...

346
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:28,076
with other people,
and I've done that.

347
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:31,308
Now, I'd better get out of here
before I lose my family.

348
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:37,648
Just so I don't wonder--you would have
gone all the way with me?

349
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:41,179
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh. Okay.

350
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:43,988
Before we negotiate,
I have to tell you...

351
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:46,928
I'm desperate to unload Lurleen
and I'll take any offer.

352
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,931
- I'll give you 50 bucks.
- You son of a--

353
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,432
Sold.

354
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:55,101
I caught my wife in bed...

355
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,265
with my best friend.

356
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,777
- You bitter?
- Yep. Bit him too.

357
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,074
And now, once again-- Lurleen.

358
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,981
Homer?

359
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:12,078
Is there any room in that bed
for a dad-burned fool?

360
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:14,419
Always has been.

361
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:17,927
I'd like to play a song
I wrote just this minute.

362
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:21,430
It's called
''Stand By Your Manager.''

363
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,159
# His name is Homer #

364
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:28,765
# He's quite a man #

365
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,002
# I tried to kiss him #

366
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,403
# But Homer ran #

367
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:41,713
# Sure wish I could say #

368
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:46,119
#That I was his #

369
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:50,353
# I hope that Marge knows #

370
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:56,730
#Just how lucky she is ##

371
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,233
I do.

372
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,660
Shh!
