1
00:00:03,663 --> 00:00:07,497
<i>##Ahh, The Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,392
D'oh!

3
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,151
Homer, you silly goose.

4
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,553
The weed-whacker's
just for the edges.

5
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,250
You'll be out here
all day.

6
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,417
I'm almost done.

7
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,961
You are a picture
and a half.

8
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:39,327
If you're finished by tomorrow,
come on over...

9
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:42,026
and we'll put the heat
to the meat.

10
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,659
Nummy-nummy-num!

11
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:44,703
I'll be there!

12
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,169
...Notty-notty-not.

13
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,366
''The Flanders are having
a beef-a-thon!

14
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,841
Incredible Nedibles!
Maudacious vittles!''

15
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,378
I think it means
he's having a barbecue.

16
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,175
Why doesn't he
just say so?!

17
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,909
He's trying to be friendly.

18
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,144
If you gave Ned Flanders
a chance--

19
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:02,312
<i>I don't care if he is
the nicest guy in the world.</i>

20
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,320
He's a jerk.

21
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,481
End of story.

22
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,218
We can't hold it against him...

23
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,420
just because he has things
better than we do.

24
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:10,757
Excuse me? Better?

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,058
Thanks a lot, Marge.

26
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,598
You put me in my place.

27
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,690
Oh, Homer...

28
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,962
It's worth feeling
three inches tall...

29
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,436
to find out what kind
of person you are...

30
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:23,441
Marge Simpson, president of
the ''We Love Flanders'' fan club.

31
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,606
Fee, fi,
fo, fum!

32
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,170
<i>I smell
the potatoes au gratin...</i>

33
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,681
of Marge Simpson.

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,115
Mm-mm-mm-mmm!

35
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,344
Hi, Ned.

36
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,614
Um... Homer sends
his apologies...

37
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,848
but, um...

38
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,585
there was some important work
at the plant...

39
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,650
that only he
could take care of.

40
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:44,821
We now return to the Canadian
Football League draft.

41
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:46,524
And so, the Rough Riders...

42
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,659
who scored only four rouges
all last season,Jack...

43
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:50,667
Stupid Flanders.

44
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:51,828
Go ahead, Marge.

45
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:52,836
Have a ball.

46
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:54,304
What if they came back...

47
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:56,398
and I was dead from not eating?

48
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,136
They'd cry their eyes out.

49
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,872
''We should have never gone
to the Flanders'.

50
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,812
''Why did we go
to the Flanders'

51
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,975
and leave Homer alone
with no food?''

52
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,815
And I'd be laughing--
Laughing from my grave.

53
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:08,911
Heh, heh, heh.

54
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,995
What is it, boy?

55
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,157
What?

56
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,063
Mmm.

57
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,330
Barbecue.

58
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,074
Ahh.

59
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,847
Mmm.

60
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,450
Hey, I'm back.
Nice seeing you.

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,452
Hey!

62
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,453
Oh!

63
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:44,853
Hey, hey, Homer!

64
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,188
Ahmmffluhff... Inside.

65
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,783
Okay. Thanks
for coming.

66
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,793
You're it.

67
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:50,794
Electricity.

68
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,455
Nuh-uh!
No electricity.

69
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:53,793
Only
in freeze tag.

70
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,924
Okay. Now you're it!

71
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,195
Hey! No tag-backs!

72
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:57,462
Yeah, you cheater.

73
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:58,730
You lie like a fly...

74
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:00,135
with a booger
in its eye.

75
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,366
The fly was funny.

76
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,567
The booger
was the icing on the cake.

77
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,372
Friends, we love you all...

78
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,776
but I also have
a sinister motive...

79
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,678
for asking you all here...

80
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,411
''sinister'' being Latin
for left-handed.

81
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,782
But enough joking.

82
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,286
That was a joke?

83
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,981
Friday, I'm saying toodle-loo...

84
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,047
to the pharmaceutical game.

85
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,355
- What's he talking about?
- Leaving?

86
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,655
No, I kid you not.

87
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:25,492
Here's the noose I had to wear
for ten years.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,524
What are you going
to do?

89
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,763
Like one out of
every nine Americans...

90
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,964
I'm left-handed,
and let me tell you...

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,974
it ain't all
peaches and cream.

92
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,634
Your writing
gets smeared.

93
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,645
Lord help you if you drive
a standard transmission.

94
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,739
I'm opening up
a one-stop store for southpaws.

95
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,546
Everything from
left-handed apple peelers...

96
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,211
to left-handed scissors.

97
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,448
Going to call it
''The Leftorium.''

98
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,128
So, Homer,
I'm dying to know...

99
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,755
what do you think
ofThe Leftorium?

100
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,299
It sounds like
a pretty dumb idea to me.

101
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,028
I know it's a little risky...

102
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,570
and it's going to be
a lot of hard work...

103
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,072
but it's going to be
a lot of fun too.

104
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,540
Fun? Where is this store,
Flanders?

105
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,372
The merry old land of Oz?

106
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,310
Oh, no. The Springfield Mall.

107
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,813
Here, you two,
make a wish.

108
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:16,813
Nah!

109
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,474
- It's fun.
- No, it isn't.

110
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,315
You must have something
you want to wish for.

111
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,981
Hmm, let's see...

112
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,819
Nah.

113
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,984
Hmm...

114
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,459
Hey!

115
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:32,156
I've got an ambition
to do some wishin'.

116
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,324
Keep your pants on,
Flanders!

117
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,834
I'm wishing as fast as I can!

118
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:38,335
Ooh!

119
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:42,999
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

120
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,168
Eh... too far.

121
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,176
Hmm...

122
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,177
Okay, ready.

123
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,577
Yes! Oh, yes!

124
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,844
Read it and weep!

125
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:53,976
In your face!

126
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,714
I've got
more chicken bone!

127
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,187
What did you wish for?

128
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,188
No! Don't say.

129
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,157
Otherwise,
it won't come true.

130
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,956
Ooh, that would be a shame.

131
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,958
Wouldn't it,
Flanders?

132
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:42,100
Mmm.

133
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,605
# Dum-da-dah... #

134
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,641
D'oh!

135
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:55,779
Bart...

136
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:58,372
how many hours a day
do you watch TV?

137
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,112
Six. Seven if there's
something good on.

138
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,278
Don't you think...

139
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,481
you should get
a little fresh air?

140
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:06,615
Yeah, but what are
you going to do?

141
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,785
TV gives so much
and asks so little.

142
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,384
It's a boy's
best friend.

143
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:11,929
That's the problem.

144
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,430
Even as we speak...

145
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:16,160
millions of children
are staring at the TV...

146
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,135
instead of getting
some much-needed exercise.

147
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:20,671
Those children's parents...

148
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,673
should be ashamed
of themselves.

149
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,834
Hello, I am Akira. Huahh!!

150
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,844
That didn't hurt very much...

151
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:29,642
because I know
the ancient art of karate.

152
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:33,651
Karate focuses the mind
and gives one self-confidence.

153
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,153
People from all walks of life:

154
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,813
- doctors...
-Hi-yaah!!

155
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,481
- homemakers...
- Hu-yaah!!

156
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,083
- landscape architects...
- Huhh-yah!!

157
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,855
- choreographers...
- Haww.

158
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:46,363
High karate at low, low prices.

159
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,365
I cannot tell a lie.

160
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,367
This is a great deal. Hohh!

161
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,498
Hey, Mom, how about...

162
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:53,970
if I learn karate?

163
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,700
Will that make you happy?

164
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:57,036
That sounds fine.

165
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,942
See, you knock TV,
and then it helps you out.

166
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:04,107
I think you owe somebody
a little apology.

167
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,982
Well, if it isn't The Leftorium.

168
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,992
Hey, Flanders,
how's business?

169
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,493
Oh, a little pokey...

170
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:18,756
but things are going
to pick up.

171
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,531
Oh! I am so sorry.

172
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,329
How much do I owe you?

173
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,666
Now that was an accident.

174
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:26,897
Really?

175
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:28,166
Well, thanks.

176
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,333
Could you validate my parking?

177
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,468
Absitively posolutely.

178
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,809
So, Flanders,
have you sold anything?

179
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,611
Not yet, but one
of the mall security guards...

180
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:39,945
took a long look...

181
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:42,179
at a left-handed
ice cream scoop.

182
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,017
Greetings, I am Akira...

183
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,751
your guide on the path
to true karate.

184
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,817
<i>And this is our map,
The Art of War by Sun Tzu.</i>

185
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:52,591
It will teach us
our most important lesson.

186
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:55,132
We learn karate,
so we need never use it.

187
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,794
<i>Um... I already know
how not to hit a guy.</i>

188
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,303
Can we break out
the nunchukus?

189
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,465
Yes, the impetuousness
of youth.

190
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,099
For now, let us read.

191
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,771
When do we break blocks of ice
with our heads?

192
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:10,474
First you must fill your head
with wisdom.

193
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,017
<i>Yo, Sensei, can I go
to the bathroom?</i>

194
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,314
You can
if you believe you can.

195
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,150
Pay money to read books.

196
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,814
The hell with this.

197
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,884
Come on.

198
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,987
Touch of Death! Touch of Death!

199
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,995
Hah, hah, hah!

200
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,231
I'm telling you.

201
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:36,035
Flanders' store
was dee-serted.

202
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:38,837
What do you think
of your bestest buddy now?

203
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,879
<i>Dad, do you know
what ''schadenfreude'' is?</i>

204
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:44,711
<i>No, I do not know
what ''schadenfreude'' is.</i>

205
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,547
Please tell me
because I'm dying to know.

206
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,519
It's German for ''shameful joy--''

207
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,022
taking pleasure
in others' suffering.

208
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,991
I'm just glad to see him
fall flat on his butt.

209
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,528
He's usually all happy
and comfortable...

210
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,861
and surrounded by loved ones,
and it makes me feel--

211
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:04,299
What's the opposite of that
''shameful joy'' thing of yours?

212
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:05,427
Sour grapes.

213
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,664
Those Germans have...

214
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,137
a word for everything.

215
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:10,538
What did you learn
in karate school?

216
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:13,100
Yeah, this better be worth
my ten bucks.

217
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:15,544
Uh... I learned
the Touch of Death.

218
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,275
Ooh, the Touch of Death.

219
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,112
Permit me
to demonstrate.

220
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:20,674
Lisa, shut your eyes.

221
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,276
Soon you will be at peace.

222
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:24,151
Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it.

223
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:25,154
Quit it! Quit it!

224
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:26,485
Quit it! Mom!!

225
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:29,527
Don't use the Touch
of Death on your sister.

226
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:40,230
Uh-oh! Got to get back
to karate class.

227
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,233
Missed a spot.

228
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,799
Dopey kid.

229
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,335
Coming through.

230
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,812
Step aside, lady.

231
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:50,848
Mmm, baby.

232
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,546
How was class?

233
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:55,984
We learned how to rip
a man's heart out...

234
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:58,147
and show it to him
before he dies.

235
00:10:58,223 --> 00:10:59,485
That will learn them.

236
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,189
What did you swipe?

237
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,785
An ''I Love Lefty'' glass.

238
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,524
Left-handed
pinking shears.

239
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:07,860
Pinking shears?

240
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,629
Let's go to the food court
and steal...

241
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,294
some baked potatoes.

242
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,838
Hey, Flanders,
when are your busy hours?

243
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,897
I expect things
to pick up soon.

244
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:20,035
I think word of mouth
is starting to spread.

245
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,305
I hear you...

246
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,973
validate parking tickets
without purchase.

247
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,516
Oh, right as rain.

248
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,314
Or as we say around here,
''left as rain.''

249
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:29,318
Just stamp it.

250
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:31,252
Okay.

251
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,560
Hey, Homer, how's
your neighbor's store doing?

252
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:37,993
Lousy.

253
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:40,031
He just sits there all day.

254
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:43,329
He'd have a great job
if he didn't own the place.

255
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,170
Crummy right-handed
corkscrews.

256
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:48,671
What does he sell?

257
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,004
Uh... well, actually, Moe, uh...

258
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,069
I don't know.

259
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,344
Lise, change the channel.

260
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:58,848
You change it.

261
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,851
Ooowaaah...

262
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,352
Okay, okay.

263
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,182
I grow weary
of this new channel.

264
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,519
Change it back.

265
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:08,524
But, Bart...

266
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,151
Eeeyaahhh...

267
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:13,322
Apple... apple... apple...

268
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,423
Come on, candy bar.

269
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,162
Hey, you're that first apple
I didn't want.

270
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:19,498
That sinks it.

271
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,335
I'm really going
to let them have it this time.

272
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:31,577
Simpson, put that box
on Mr. Burns' desk.

273
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,742
Chop-chop!

274
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:35,886
Oh, look, Smithers.

275
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,388
Another member
of our nuclear family...

276
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,481
with some helpful
suggestions.

277
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,253
And what's your name?

278
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:43,487
Homer Simpson, sir.

279
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:44,994
Simpson, eh?

280
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,861
Mm-hmm. I'm Monty Burns.

281
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:51,702
''Keep that handsome owner
out of sight.

282
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,102
He's distracting
the female employees.''

283
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:55,605
Smithers?

284
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,437
Got me, sir.

285
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,443
Oh, it's a real one.

286
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:02,674
''No more apples
in the vending machine, please.''

287
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:05,181
Well, that's almost a sentence.

288
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,512
Can I leave?

289
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,279
Of course,
and don't worry.

290
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:11,254
There will be plenty
of apples for you.

291
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:14,450
Nobody will take away
your precious apples.

292
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,357
The note was asking you to--

293
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,421
No, tell my secretary I said
you could have a free apple.

294
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:24,229
She'll make everything
all right. I promise.

295
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,931
Damned infernal gizmo.

296
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,531
My kingdom for
a left-handed can opener!

297
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,872
Uh, Mr. Burns...

298
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:35,640
Come on, Homer.
Tell him about the store.

299
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,306
I'm dying out here.

300
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:38,974
Sorry, Flanders.

301
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:41,608
Huh?

302
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,586
Are you sure...

303
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:45,145
you're not interested?

304
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:47,316
$200 is only
the asking price.

305
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:48,359
Sorry, Ned.

306
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:49,859
Hey, I'm flexible.

307
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:52,294
You don't have to pay
all at once.

308
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:55,332
I'll be here all night
if you change your mind.

309
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,368
Hey, Flanders,
is everything okay?

310
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:58,697
Oh, yeah, sure.

311
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,170
See anything you like?

312
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,332
Oh, it's not good enough
for you...

313
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,342
but it's good enough for me?

314
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,675
<i>I wouldn't be caught dead
buying this... Hello.</i>

315
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,772
Got your eye on
the gas grill, huh?

316
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,339
She's a butane beaut.

317
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,509
I'll give you 20.

318
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:17,919
Homer, I paid $300
for this just last year.

319
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,219
$20. Take it or leave it.

320
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,657
Oh, Homer, be reasonable.

321
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:25,218
Sorry, no cash for Neddy.

322
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:26,820
Homer keep all money.

323
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,160
Bye-bye, Neddy.

324
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,495
All right, Homer.

325
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,056
$20?

326
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,067
$20.

327
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:31,830
I don't want it.

328
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:32,335
What?!

329
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:33,631
It was...

330
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:34,899
a passing fancy.

331
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,737
Although, if you threw in
a few lawn chairs...

332
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,006
maybe that tool bench,
it might rekindle my interest.

333
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,047
Hey, Bartely-boobely.

334
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:45,639
Care for a steakarooni?

335
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:49,209
Sounds scrum-diddley-umptious,
dear old duddely-doodely.

336
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:52,051
[ Homer]
Duddely-doodely.

337
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:54,387
This is the Flanders'
living room set.

338
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:55,983
What did you
pay for this?

339
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,153
Only 7 5 beans.

340
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:00,720
$7 5?
Ned must be desperate.

341
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,290
I'm sure you did nothing
to discourage this...

342
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:05,427
you scavenger of human misery.

343
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,869
Hey! Keep your hands off
my china hutch.

344
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:14,672
I'm Chuck Ellis...

345
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,180
from the Springfield
Collection Agency...

346
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:20,012
and I'm here to ask you
why you don't think...

347
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:21,881
you need to pay your bills?

348
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:25,320
Oh, I know I need to pay them,
but there's just so many.

349
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,517
Do you feel good owing money?

350
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,322
We've been very patient
with you, Mr. Flanders.

351
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,192
I know, but-- Wait a minute.

352
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:33,696
I'm Homer Simpson.

353
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,630
Ned Flanders lives
over there.

354
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,689
Oh.

355
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,895
Flanders is in debt?
Are you sure?

356
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,131
We don't make mistakes.

357
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,572
Damned right-handed ledgers.

358
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,472
I can't write
in these things.

359
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:46,669
There's a store...

360
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:48,143
You're Homer Simpson?

361
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,237
See you Thursday.

362
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,246
D'oh!

363
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,942
Knock 'em dead, boy.

364
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:54,917
Kid's going to be
a black belt in no time.

365
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:04,655
Ohhh...

366
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,589
Check out
the saxophone.

367
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,599
Pretty boss...

368
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:14,602
but something's
stuck on it.

369
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,602
Hey!

370
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:18,504
Hey, look at me.

371
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:19,836
I'm Elvis, man!

372
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:20,841
Give that back!

373
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,207
That to me!

374
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:23,870
If you want it,
take it.

375
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,715
Okay. We're sorry.

376
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:31,549
This time, we're really
going to give it to you.

377
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,780
Hey, stop that!

378
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:40,285
Hey, Lise, something wrong?

379
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:41,727
Not anymore!

380
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:43,856
You punks are
about to get...

381
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:46,265
a taste
of your own medicine.

382
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,566
This is my brother,
and he knows karate.

383
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:50,764
Uh-oh.

384
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,070
Oh, we're
real scared.

385
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,235
Please don't
hurt us, Bart.

386
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,506
What are you going to do?

387
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,775
Throw your diapers at us?

388
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,177
Just keep laughing.

389
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,843
It only makes him
madder.

390
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,353
Start them off
with the Touch of Death...

391
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:07,582
and go from there.

392
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:10,454
I think they've learned
their lesson, Lise.

393
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:13,086
We want to see
the Touch of Death.

394
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,460
Come on, Karate Kid.
Waste me.

395
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:24,998
It's funny how two wrongs
sometimes make a right.

396
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:31,170
Homer...

397
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:32,737
over here.

398
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:37,684
Flanders, I want
to give you your stuff back.

399
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:41,018
Well, there's no house
to put it in, Homer.

400
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,752
Not since that nice fellow
from the bank--

401
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:47,091
who was only doing his job--
came and locked it up.

402
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:48,596
You're living in your car?

403
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:50,859
Oh, no. It's just
a camp-out tonight...

404
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:54,164
then off to my sister's
apartment in Capital City.

405
00:17:54,236 --> 00:17:56,227
What do you think, kids?

406
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:57,397
The big city.

407
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:01,470
Todd, I want to talk
to your Uncle Homer.

408
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:04,069
You're head of the car
till I get back.

409
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:05,272
Okay, Dad.

410
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:17,783
Listen to that singing.

411
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,124
Those poor fools.

412
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:22,528
Homer, I'm ruined.

413
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,190
I know.

414
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:25,563
At times like these...

415
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,603
I used to turn to the Bible
and find solace...

416
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:30,195
but even the Good Book...

417
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:32,365
can't help me now.

418
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:33,533
Why not?

419
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:36,339
I sold it to you
for seven cents.

420
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:39,813
You know, ever since
that barbecue...

421
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,043
nothing's gone right.

422
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:44,381
It's like there's been...

423
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:45,613
a curse on me.

424
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:48,856
It's all my fault.

425
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:50,016
No, it's not.

426
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:50,786
Yes, it is.

427
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,691
You tried to warn me...

428
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:55,229
about gambling
my family's future...

429
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:56,992
on some pig in a poke.

430
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,260
I didn't listen.

431
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,666
Homer, you were
a true friend.

432
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:02,169
No, I was a swine.

433
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,263
Listen, Flanders.

434
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,137
Do you still have
that store?

435
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,436
For two more days.

436
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:10,774
Then it becomes
Libertarian Party headquarters.

437
00:19:10,846 --> 00:19:12,905
I hope they have better luck.

438
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:15,143
You open that store tomorrow.

439
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:16,912
Homer, there's no point.

440
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:19,079
I said do it!

441
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,424
Hello,Jerry? Homer Simpson.

442
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:26,757
Remember last month
when I paid back that loan?

443
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:29,855
<i>Well, now I need you
to do a favor for me.</i>

444
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:32,594
A left-handed corkscrew?

445
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:33,828
Oh, baby.

446
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:36,269
''Kiss me-- I'm left-handed?''

447
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:39,903
That's a classic.

448
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:40,907
Whoa!

449
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:42,068
It's Homer Simpson.

450
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:43,338
Tell him I went out.

451
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:45,437
He needs you
to help Ned Flanders.

452
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:46,981
Ned is in trouble?!

453
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,108
Smithers, I'm licked.

454
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:51,311
You open this can.

455
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,651
Okay, but you softened
it up for me.

456
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:55,883
Hold it, Smithers.

457
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,152
<i>I'll open the can.</i>

458
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:58,284
But, sir, how?

459
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,292
To the mall!

460
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,988
I'll explain on the way.

461
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:07,634
Hurry, Neddy, hurry.

462
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:09,762
Oh, golly, it's a miracle.

463
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:12,640
Come on, lefties.

464
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,039
What did I tell you?

465
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:15,701
Homer?

466
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:19,145
It's all here,
and it's all backwards.

467
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:20,374
That's right.

468
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:30,920
The worm has turned, has it not,
my tin-plated friend?

469
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:34,121
Look at you--
You who were once so proud.

470
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:37,597
Feel the wrath
of the left hand of Burns.

471
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,897
My life today.

472
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,063
Wow! What an icebreaker.

473
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:44,332
Left-handed ledgers.

474
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:47,000
Now, I can write
all the way to the edge.

475
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:49,977
Aha! Left-handed nunchukas.

476
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:52,206
Wow!

477
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,044
The boys
at the Diners Club...

478
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,175
will think I've
gone quite mad.

479
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:58,776
Oh, I'll have
that roadster as well.

480
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:02,184
Yes, sir.

481
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:04,191
Huzzah for the shopkeep.

482
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,159
Huzzah!

483
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:09,891
Homer, affordable tract housing
made us neighbors...

484
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:11,796
but you made us friends.

485
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,300
To Ned Flanders...

486
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:16,031
the richest left-handed man
in town.

487
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:17,197
Everybody!

488
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:49,904
- Shh!
