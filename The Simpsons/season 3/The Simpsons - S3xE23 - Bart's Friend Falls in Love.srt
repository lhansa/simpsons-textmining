6
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,919
Bart, look at this.

7
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:25,957
My dad took me to
Circus of Values last night

8
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:28,618
and said I could get
anything I wanted.

9
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:31,355
Cool-- An oversize
novelty billiard ball.

10
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,228
You shake it up
and it tells the future.

11
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:35,231
Really?

12
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,232
Uh-huh.

13
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,701

Wow, it does work!

16
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:44,567
Let me try.

17
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:47,510
Will... I get
beat up today?

18
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:50,808

19
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:52,941
That ball knows everything.

20
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:55,812
I got one.

Lord knows I do.

I'm a good student.

34
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:34,019
Yeah, sure, and they told me
I'd get a big parade

00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,026
when I got back from 'Nam.

36
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,686
Instead, they spat on me.

37
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,696
I can still feel it searing.

38
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:41,026
So, let's just see

39
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,533
what the permanent record
has to say.

40
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:46,196
No detention,
fairly good attendance...

41
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,967
I see you beat
that bed-wetting problem.

42
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:52,135
Don't worry.
They'll forget...

43
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,644
just like they forgot about me

44
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:58,149
in that tiger cage
for 1 8 agonizing months.

45
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,878
Every night I wake up screaming.

46
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:03,420
Well, let's meet
your classmates.

47
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:07,318
Bart, was this thing
right about your test?

48
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:10,520
To those who doubt
the Magic Eight Ball's power

49
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:14,497
I say, behold my ''F.''

50
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,658
Attention, class.

51
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,725
I have a new student for you.

52
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:20,737
Great.Just keep
packing them in, Seymour.

53
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:22,830
We should discuss
this later.

54
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,399
It's never easy
to come to a new school.

55
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:27,342
Let's make her feel
right at home.

56
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:29,937
<i>Please say a big

59
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,242
Oh, right.

60
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:38,118
How embarrassing for you.

61
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:39,315
Well, good-bye.

62
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,053
I'm sure this is
a little scary for you...

63
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:42,718
Uh-huh.

64
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,193
So why don't you

65
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:45,854
tell us about yourself?

66
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:47,330
I'll be grading you

67
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,661

68
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,894
We just moved here from Phoenix.

69
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:52,903
My dad's

70
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,531
<i>He came here because of

71

<i>and lackluster police force.</i>

72
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,468
All my friends
are back in Phoenix

73
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:03,480
and this town has a weird smell
that you're all probably used to

74
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:04,572
but I'm not.

75
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,241
It takes about six weeks.

76
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:09,151
Hey, Milhouse, would you
like a wet willie?

77
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,312
Sure.

78
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:12,621
Eww!

79
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:15,023
Victim number four.

80
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:17,960
Louis, can I interest you
in a wet willie?

81
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,691
Sure... aah!

82
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:26,000
When I find out who
hit me with ball

83
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,165
I'm going to tear them a new..!

84
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:31,970
Whoa!

85
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:34,375

89
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:43,316

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,976
in a frank
and straightforward manner.

100
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:08,978
And now, here's...

101
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:13,650
This is Fuzzy Bunny.

102
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:14,980
About a year ago

103
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:17,521
he noticed
his voice was changing

104
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:19,420
he had terrible acne

105
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:22,585
and had fur
where there was no fur before.

106
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:25,186
He also noticed Fluffy Bunny.

107
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:26,491
Boring.

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,699
<i>Fluffy and Fuzzy</i>

109
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,293
went to the park

110
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,701
the ice cream social

111
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:34,932
the boat show

112
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:37,338
and other wholesome activities

113
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,343
and they never ruined their fun

114
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:42,847
by giving in to their throbbing
biological urges.

115
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:44,404
Then came the big day.

116
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:47,349
Fluffy and Fuzzy got married.

117
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,013
<i>That night came the honeymoon.</i>

118
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,315
Eww!

119
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:55,916
She's faking it.

120
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:59,760
The most satisfying part
was knowing that they waited.

121
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:01,059
Nine months later

122
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:04,295
Fluffy gave birth
to 1 4 beautiful bunnies.

123
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:05,666
Eight survive.

124
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:08,035
And now that you know
how it's done...

125
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:10,301
don't do it.

126
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,104
Any questions?

127
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:14,304
Mrs. Krabappel

128
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,280
how come you don't live
with Mr. Krabappel?

129
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:18,781
Because Mr. Krabappel

130
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,546
chased something fluffy
down a rabbit hole.

131
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,712
How do we know
when we fall in love?

132
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:25,085
Oh, don't you worry.

133
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:27,488
Most of you
will never fall in love

134
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,119
and marry out of fear
of dying alone.

135
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:33,687
How do I create a half man,
half monkey-type creature?

136
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:35,858
I'm sorry,
that would be playing God.

137
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,198
God, shmod--
I want my monkey man.

138
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:42,935
Uh... that's a nice dress.

139
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:44,338
My dad makes me wear it.

140
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,341
I hate it.

141
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,843
I hate it too.

142
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,744
Uh... can I walk you home?

143
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:50,508
Okay.

144
00:07:50,582 --> 00:07:51,571
Everybody on.

145
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:52,638
No shoving.

146
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:53,706
Just kidding.

147
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:55,582
You can shove all you want.

148
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:57,644
Hey, Otto Man,
you can't leave.

149
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,155
Milhouse isn't here yet.

150
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:00,691
No time, Bart Dude.

151
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,627
My girlfriend's dancing topless
at the airport bar

152
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,254

156
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:17,264
What's with the skirt?

157
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:19,936
I've brought friends
to this tree house before.

158
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:21,035
But never a girl.

159
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:23,342
What if I want
to strut around nude?

160
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:24,938
Maybe I should go.

161
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:26,779
No, you can stay.

162
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:28,751

That excess blubber

179
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,687
could fill two-fifths
of the Grand Canyon.

00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,697

I'll give it a chance.

185
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:35,906
Americans have grown up

186
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:38,036
with the image
of the jolly fat man--

187
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,374
Dom DeLuise

188
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:41,210
Alfred Hitchcock, and, of course

189
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:42,613
Santa Claus.

190
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,911
But in real life

191
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:47,045
Santa would be suffering
from gall stones

192
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:50,352
hypertension, impotence,
and diabetes.

193
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:07,767
I wish they had never
invented fried cheese.

194
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,103
We got to widen
the hole.

195
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,773
Hurry-- The chain's
starting to give.

196
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:24,048
<i>We take 1 8 ounces
of sizzling ground beef</i>

197
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,992
<i>and soak it
in rich creamery butter.</i>

198
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:31,589
Then we top it off with bacon,
ham, and a fried egg.

199
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,260
<i>We call it
the Good Morning Burger.</i>

200
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:38,404
I've got to help him.

201
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:41,203
Okay, Milhouse

202
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:44,540
I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski
baseball card

203
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:46,204
for my Omar Vizquel.

204
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,212
<i>Deal.</i>

205
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,545
Next, your Mickey Mantle

206
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:52,643
for my picture
of Homer on the couch.

207
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,449
Milhouse, I've got to go.

208
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:58,458
My dad thinks I'm having
my braces examined.

209
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:02,053
Well, you kind of
sort of are.

210
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:09,462
Milhouse, we're living
in the age of cooties.

211
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:12,097
I can't believe
the risk you're running.

212
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,664
Besides, what's so great
about kissing?

213
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,471
It's not just
the kissing.

214
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:18,910
<i>A lot of it is
waiting to kiss.</i>

215
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,744
You know, like when you open
an Eskimo Pie

216
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:24,580
and you wait just a little
for it to melt?

217
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:26,085
But she doesn't melt.

218
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,314
Oh, yes, she does.

219
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,222
We start with pure
milk chocolate...

220
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:32,452
Chocolate...

221
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:35,087
<i>...add a layer
of farm-fresh honey...</i>

222
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,096
Oh, sweet.

223
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,361
<i>...then we sprinkle on
four kinds of sugar...</i>

224
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,865
<i>...and dip it
in rich creamery butter.</i>

225
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,465
What if I told you
you could lose weight

226
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:50,807
without dieting
or lifting a finger?

227
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,869
I'd say you're
a lying scumbag.

228
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:53,914
Why, sweetie?

229
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,040
<i>According to Eternity magazine</i>

230
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:58,381
you can lose weight
subliminally.

231
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:01,046
An idea is subtly implanted
in your head

232
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:02,646
without your knowing it.

233
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,385
That's a load
of rich creamery butter.

234
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,824
You listen to tapes

235
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:07,861
<i>while you sleep.</i>

236
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,521
<i>As you hear New Age music</i>

237
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:11,758
a powerful message
goes to your brain

238
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,265
telling you to eat less.

239
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:16,326
<i>Lose weight and listen
to New Age music? Wow.</i>

240
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,338
What do you think, Marge?

241
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:21,933
Oh, Homer, I love you
just the way you are.

242
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,738
Lisa, what's that number?

243
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,712
I'd like to place an order
for my husband.

244
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,249
Would he like to lose weight,
stop smoking

245
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:32,650
learn the state capitals,
master hostage negotiations..?

246
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,247
Hmm... hostage negotiations.

247
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:40,055
Listen, Tabbouleh, we're
ignoring all your demands.

248
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,027
What do you say to that?

249
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,930
Give me
the weight loss tape.

250
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:53,038
We're out of
''Subliminally Slim.''

251
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:56,873
Uh... send them
the vocabulary builder.

252
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,502
Here you go, fatso.

253
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,513
<i>So long, stomach.</i>

254
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,049
We've had a lot
of great memories.

255
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:29,275
Hello. This is
Dr. Marvin Monroe.

256
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,470
Let's build your vocabulary.

257
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,240
Abattoir: Slaughterhouse.

258
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:36,181
''The cow was slaughtered
in the abattoir.''

259
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:44,652
Has the weight loss tape
reduced your appetite?

260
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:45,851
Lamentably, no.

261
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,759
My gastronomic rapacity
knows no satiety.

262
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:56,068
Don't you usually
play with Milhouse?

263
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:57,536
He has a girlfriend.

264
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,039
Milhouse?

265
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,870
Yeah. All they do is kiss.

266
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,375
How cute.

267
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:06,038
They don't open
their mouths, do they?

268
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:07,045
No.

269
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,411
How cute.

270
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,819
Hey, Martin.

271
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:22,556
No one has sat next to me
since I successfully lobbied

272
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,758
to have the school day
extended by 20 minutes.

273
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,801
I'm looking for a friend

274
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,096
who won't leave me

275
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,137
for a girl.

276
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,263
I'm as unpopular
with the ladies

277
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,897
as I am with the chaps.

278
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,100
Yeah, right.

279
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,736
Do you want to do something
after school?

280
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:38,938
It's a date.

281
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:41,675
Everyone, Bart and I
would like to announce

282
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,011
that we friends.

283
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:49,353
Bart, would you care
to listen to me play the lute?

284
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,186
Uh... sure.

285
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:05,371
Is that tape working?

286
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,634
You ate three desserts
tonight.

287
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,505
Forbearance is the watchword.

288
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:12,876
That triumvirate of twinkies
overwhelmed my resolve.

289
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:15,814
There's another thing
I want to talk about.

290
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:17,441
Tut, tut, gentle Marge.

291
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:18,644
Here in the boudoir

292
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,210
the gourmand
metamorphosizes into...

293
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,721
the voluptuary!

294
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,053
What in God's name
are you talking about?

295
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,528
Oh.

296
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,335
Mmm...

297
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:49,743
Heh...

298
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,855
Hey, guys.

299
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:56,480
<i>Wow, that really took my mind</i>

300
00:15:56,557 --> 00:16:00,288
off those awful,
transforming space mutants.

301
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:01,328
Good.

302
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,693
Man, I could sure go
for a snack.

303
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:04,856
Me too.

304
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:13,166
D'oh!

305
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,037
Hey, I've got an idea.

306
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:18,636
Why don't we go spit
on the principal's car?

307
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,374
Listen, Bart, there's
such a thing

308
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,042
as spending
too much time together.

309
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:25,483
Oh, fine.

310
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:28,113
I'm tired of watching
you two lip wrestle.

311
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:31,090
There's plenty of other ways
to be grossed out.

312
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,686
Bart, wait.

313
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:36,286
Yeah?

314
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,352
Uh...

315
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,661
could we still use
your tree house?

316
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,030
What? Get bent.

317
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,501
If her father catches us,
he'll kill her.

318
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,596
All right, Milhouse.

319
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,834
You can use my tree house.

320
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:49,170
Thanks, Bart.

321
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:52,838
# Samantha and Milhouse
sitting in a tree #

322
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:56,178
#About to lose their privacy ##

323
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:04,015
<i>Now there's</i>

324
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:06,520
a Machiavellian
countenance.

325
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,579
Ooh, a sextet of ale!

326
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:10,885
Hello, Mr. Stanky?

327
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,393
I have shocking news
about Samantha.

328
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:14,588
Who am I?

329
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:16,927
Let's just say I'm
concerned prude

330
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:19,262
with lot of time on his hands.

331
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:24,502
I bet you had peanut butter
for breakfast.

332
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:27,333
Yeah.

333
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:28,376
Samantha!

334
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:29,034
Dad!

335
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:31,773
Noooooo!

336
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,838
Samantha, you're my little girl

337
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:36,816
and sometimes my imagination
runs away with me.

338
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:38,546
Just tell me
what happened.

339
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,678
Milhouse and I...

340
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:40,813
That's enough!

341
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,414
I'm putting you in
an all-girl school.

342
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:46,325
You're never going to see
that boy again.

343
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:47,327
Milhouse!

344
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:48,863
Samantha!

345
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,364
Well, 'tis better
to have loved and lost...

346
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:55,664
yatta, yatta, yatta.

347
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:57,329
Let's go to the arcade.

348
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:58,839
How could this happen?

349
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:01,569
We started out
like Romeo and Juliet

350
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:03,736
but it ended up
in tragedy.

351
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,178
Hierospacy:
Predicting the future

352
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:08,876
through the study
of animal entrails.

353
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,884
Dad! Do you know
what today is?

354
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,180
The vernal equinox?

355
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:13,278
No, it's two weeks

356
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:15,516
since you got
that weight-loss tape.

357
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,217
Let's get you on the scale.

358
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:21,093
You've gained 1 3 pounds.

359
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:24,894
Disingenuous mountebanks with
their subliminal chicanery--

360
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:26,900
A pox on them!

361
00:18:28,904 --> 00:18:31,065
There stands
a broken man.

362
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:34,267
It's recess everywhere
but in his heart.

363
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:36,674
Hey, Bart, according
to this magazine

364
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,303
in another million years

365
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,507
man will have
an extra finger.

366
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:42,641
Five fingers?
Ooh-- Freak show!

367
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:45,550
Lise, I need some advice
and mom's not here.

368
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,882
What about dad?

369
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:49,549
I couldn't understand
what he was saying.

370
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:50,556
I feel terrible.

371
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,149
I ratted on my best friend

372
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:53,751
and he doesn't even know.

373
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:56,024
<i>According to
Eternity magazine</i>

374
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:57,394
the feeling of guilt

375
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,934
has been linked
to gamephenomene.

376
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,526
Dow Chemical is developing
a minty gel

377
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:04,367
to eliminate excess guilt

378
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:07,374
but it won't be on the market
for six months

379
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:10,605
so I guess you'll have
to confess to Milhouse.

380
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:14,405
Bart, I'm glad you're here.

381
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,111
Milhouse could use
a friend like you.

382
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:21,851
Milhouse?

383
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:24,255
Bart, I don't want you
to see me cry.

384
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:25,486
Oh, come on.

385
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,324
You cry when they're out
of chocolate milk.

386
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:30,830
You cry when you're doing
long division

387
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:33,094
and you have
a remainder left over.

388
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:36,899
Well, I didn't want you
to see me cry this time.

389
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:39,463
Milhouse, I got
a confession to make.

390
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,032
I'm the one who narc'ed
on your kissing.

391
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,042
What?!

392
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:50,918
Milhouse is out bed
and full beans.

393
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:52,783
Whoa, it's a miracle!

394
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:09,236
I bet the eight ball
didn't see that one coming.

395
00:20:09,304 --> 00:20:10,236
Yeah.

396
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:12,205
Marge...

397
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:13,605
where's that...

398
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:15,267
metal dealie...

399
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,277
you use to...

400
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:19,040
dig... food?

401
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:20,172
You mean, a spoon?

402
00:20:20,248 --> 00:20:21,772
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

403
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:24,941
Oh, this is good.

404
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:30,019
Are you sure
you want to do this?

405
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,252
I can't stop thinking
about her.

406
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:35,160
Even these gates remind me
of her braces.

407
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,323
How are we going
to find her?

408
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,993
<i>She's wearing a plaid jumper.</i>

409
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:41,000
Milhouse!

410
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:42,093
Samantha!

411
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,564
I went to Circus of Values

412
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,666
and bought you a ten-gallon tub
of gummi bears.

413
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:51,970
I'm sorry about
getting you thrown

414
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:53,378
in the penguin house.

415
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:54,745
That's all right, Bart.

416
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:56,249
I love Saint Sebastian's.

417
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:59,116
It's run by a group
of French Canadian nuns.

418
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:00,154
They're very nice

419
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,984
except they never let me out.

420
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,492
<i>Samantha, ne pas des boys.</i>

421
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:17,428
I have to go now,
Milhouse.

422
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:20,269
I'd better not.

423
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,435
It's 50 rosaries
a kiss.

424
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,943
Oh, okay.

425
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:25,445
Oh, what the heck.

426
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:30,243
Bart

427
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:33,082
think I can ever find
another one like her?

428
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:35,645
You're asking
the wrong guy, Milhouse.

429
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,885
They all look alike to me.

430
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:41,360
Now, let's go whip donuts
at old people.

431
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,951
- Shh!
