00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:39,025
D'oh!

00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:02,127
<i>Hello, I'm Kent Brockman,
and this is Eye on Springfield.</i>

00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:07,896
<i>[ Rock And Roll

5
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,288
Wow. Info-tainment.

6
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,298
Tonight

7
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,335
we salute the silver anniversary

8
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,802
of the Great Springfield
Tire Yard Fire.

9
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,840
25 years
and still burning strong.

10
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,137
We watch
Springfield's oldest man

11
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,440
meet Springfield's fattest man.

12
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,070
He's not so fat.

13
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,307
And we visit

14
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:56,407
with heavyweight champion
Dredrick Tatum

15
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:59,419
who reminisces about growing up
in Springfield.

16
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:00,977
It was a dump.

17
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:04,183
If you see me there,
you know I up bad.

18
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:08,194
But first, part seven
of our eye-opening look

19
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,991
at the bikini.

20
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,102
Whoa-- T and A!

21
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,762
Why are you still up?

22
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,466
<i>- Lisa's slumber party.</i>

23
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:24,443
Who can sleep with those five evil hens
cackling and plotting against me?

24
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,946
They've got better things
to talk about than you.

25
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,447
Sheesh, what an ego.

26
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,780
Lisa, your brother
is so gross.

27
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,785
You should smell
his room.

28
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,520
Now remember, Wanda,
whatever shape the wax takes

29
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,856
that's what your
husband's job will be.

30
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,491
It's a mop.

31
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,261
My husband will be a janitor.

32
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,802
That looks like
an Olympic torch to me.

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,394
He could be an athlete

34
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,872
and go on to have
a great acting career.

35
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,076
It's a dustpan.

36
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,512
The wax never lies.

37
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,573
<i>Let's play truth or dare.</i>

38
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,051
Truth or dare! Truth or dare!

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,712
I'll take... dare.

40
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,085
I dare you to...

41
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,623
kiss Lisa's brother.

42
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,090
Eww!!

43
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:18,589
What the..?

44
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,628
Aaaaahh!

45
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,570
I'm telling mom and dad.

46
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,571
Who?

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,766
Mom and dad.

48
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,173
Jinx!

49
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:32,007
#You can't talk till somebody
says your name #

50
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,642
Coming up next:
An elephant who never forgets...

51
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,309
to brush!

52
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,649
What is it, boy?

53
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,922
Is anything the matter,
my son?

54
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,151
Talk to me, young man.

55
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,454
Say your name?

56
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,396
Why should I do that,
my lad?

57
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,832
Because I'm jinxed,
damn it!... Ow!

58
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:55,994
What was that for?

59
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,901
You spoke
while you were jinxed

60
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,564
so I get to punch you.

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,232
Sorry, it's the law.

62
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,341
There he is.

63
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,503
Let's give him
a makeover.

64
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,012
Run for it, boy!

65
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,415
Get him! Get him! Get him!

66
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,898
Aaaaahh!

67
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,835
Oof!.

68
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,167
Come here, Maggie.

69
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,138
Huh?!

70
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,309
That's it, I'm out of here.

71
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,618
Hiya, Homer.

72
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,453
What's the matter, Moe?

73
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,051
Oh, business is slow.

74
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,120
People are healthier
and drinking less.

75
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,098
If it wasn't for
the junior high school next door

76
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,134
no one would even use
the cigarette machine.

77
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,726
Yeah, things are tough.

78
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,897
Increased job satisfaction
and family togetherness

79
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,534
are poison for a purveyor
of mind-numbing intoxicants.

80
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,440
Got a beer?

81
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,307
Yeah, sure.

82
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,345
Oh, sorry.

83
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,109
I forgot
we're out of beer.

84
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:15,773
Aahh!

85
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,908
I got behind

86
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,451
on my beer payments.

87
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,781
The distributor
cut me off

88
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:23,415
and I spent my last ten grand
on the love tester.

89
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,288
You're too late,
Homer.

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,918
Barney sucked it dry.

91
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,963
Cut his gums up
pretty bad.

92
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,361
Ohh!

93
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,457
Take it easy, Homer.

94
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,799
I learned how to make other
drinks at bartender's school.

95
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,405
Gin and... tonic?

96
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,031
Do they mix?

97
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,042
Hey, I know a good drink.

98
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,975
Really hits the spot.

99
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,910
I invented it myself.

100
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,108
<i>One night,
Marge's beastly sisters</i>

101
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,708
<i>were showing slides
from their vacation.</i>

102
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,343
And this is Patty

103
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,217
trying to plug her razor

104
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,224
into those ungodly
Czechoslovakian outlets.

105
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,227
As you can see, we
never got the hang of it.

106
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,523
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

107
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,064
<i>As I stared
at that hairy drumstick</i>

108
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,861
<i>I knew I needed a drink.</i>

109
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:10,062
Patty, Selma, would you
excuse me for a moment?

110
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,470
If you're going for a beer,
this is the last one.

111
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,199
D'oh!

112
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,243
<i>I decided to mix</i>

113
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,676
<i>the little bits that were left
in every liquor bottle.</i>

114
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,111
<i>In my haste</i>

115
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,581
<i>I had grabbed a bottle
of the kids'cough syrup.</i>

116
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,086
<i>It passed the first test--</i>

117
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,752
<i>I didn't go blind.</i>

118
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,819
They say everyone can float
in the Dead Sea

119
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,229
but Selma sank
right to the bottom.

120
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,469
Huh?!

121
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:47,698
<i>I don't know the scientific
explanation</i>

122
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,709
<i>but fire made it good.</i>

123
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,711
Sounds like one hell
of a drink.

124
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,110
What do you call it?

125
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,545
A Flaming Homer.

126
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,946
Why don't you

127
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,507
make us up a couple
of Flaming Homers?

128
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,177
You got any
cough syrup?

129
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,222
Let me check
the lost and found.

130
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,553
Bowie knife, troll doll...

131
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,559
glass eye...

132
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,456
Oh, here we are.

133
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,571
It's not without it's charm.

134
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,403
Try lighting it on fire.

135
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,909
Hmm?!

136
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,076
Wow!

137
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,810
Homer, it's like there's
a party in my mouth

138
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,818
and everyone's invited.

139
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,751
Hey,
your love tester's busted.

140
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,414
I want my nickel back.

141
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,416
Hey, buddy,
have one on the house.

142
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,597
Hey, this drink is delicious

143
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,599
and my phlegm feels looser.

144
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,100
What do you call it?

145
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,829
It's called a Flaming...

146
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:50,767
...Moe!

147
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,601
It's called a Flaming Moe.

148
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,368
<i>That's right, a Flaming Moe.</i>

149
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,534
My name is Moe,
and I invented it.

150
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,373
What are you looking at,
Homer?

151
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,359
It's a Flaming Moe.

152
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,621
- Oh!
- Oh!

153
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,125
Hey, what's this?

154
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,634
A sneeze guard.

155
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,135
Wow, it really works!

156
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:16,436
It hasn't been this crowded
since the government

157
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:18,500
cracked down on you
for accepting food stamps.

158
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:20,807
Think my drink had something
to do with it?

159
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,043
Who can say?
It's probably a combination of things.

160
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,981
Another pitcher
of Flaming Moes.

161
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:28,611
I hate this joint,
but I love that drink.

162
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:29,813
Ohhh.

163
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,517
I couldn't help
noticing your sign.

164
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:35,151
You mean, '' Bartenders
Do It 'Til You Barf''?

165
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:37,320
Above that store-bought
drollery.

166
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,591
Why don't we fill out
an application.

167
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:42,759
I'll need your name,
measurements, and turn-ons.

168
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:44,996
You expect me to tell you that?

169
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,935
You could,
but I find this way

170
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,167
is much more accurate,
and fun.

171
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,675
Ugh! What salary do you offer?

172
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:53,109
Minimum wage and tips.

173
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,579
<i>Of course,
there are fringe benefits.</i>

174
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:56,478
Such as?

175
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,141
An unforgettable weekend

176
00:08:58,217 --> 00:08:59,343
at Club Moe.

177
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:01,750
<i>I'd prefer to vacation
someplace hot.</i>

178
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:03,118
- Whoo!
- Ha-ha!

179
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,349
- Ow!
- Whoo!

180
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:06,323
I like your moxie, kid.

181
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:07,723
You're hired.

182
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:09,818
You shan't regret this.

183
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:11,123
Methinks I shan't.

184
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,825
Are you the genius
behind the Flaming Moe?

185
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,560
- Yes, I...
- I'm your man.

186
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:17,898
I work for Tipsy McStagger's

187
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,495
good time drinking
and eating emporium.

188
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,667
Oh, yeah? Hey, what's
Mr. McStagger really like?

189
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:25,972
Tipsy McStagger
is just a composite

190
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:27,842
of other successful logos.

191
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:29,141
You tell him for me

192
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:32,013
that he makes
one great mozzarella stick.

193
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:32,982
Yes, I will.

194
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,680
I've got a proposition
for you.

195
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:38,484
Your Flaming Moe
is perfect for our chain.

196
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,582
We want to buy the recipe.

197
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:41,819
It's not for sale.

198
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:44,829
Do you know how much
of my blood and sweat

199
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:46,159
are in this drink?

200
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,825
Uh... figure of speech.

201
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:49,925
Sorry, Harv.

202
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll be back.

203
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:57,835
Good for you, Moe.

204
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,741
Only an idiot
would give away

205
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:01,837
a million-dollar idea
like that.

206
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:02,972
Ohhh.

207
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:04,982
<i>The next time you use</i>

208
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,517
a gas chromatograph

209
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,349
remember to thank
Mr. A.J.P. Martin.

210
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,683
Brilliant, Martin.

211
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:13,816
Once again you've wrecked
the grading curve.

212
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,589
I pity the student
who has to follow you.

213
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:18,994
Bart Simpson,
you're next.

214
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:22,033
''The Inventor I Admire''
by Bart Simpson.

215
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:25,036
The inventor I admire
is not a rich man

216
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:27,868
or a famous man,
or even a smart man.

217
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,204
He's my father, Homer Simpson

218
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:32,540
creator of...
# Dun-da-da-dah #

219
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,511
The Flaming Homer!

220
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,706
The Flaming Homer?

221
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,373
You mean the Flaming Moe

222
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,974
and your dad
didn't invent it, you wuss.

223
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:41,451
Moe the bartender did.

224
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,646
Everyone knows that.

225
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:43,688
It's not true.

226
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:45,155
My father invented it.

227
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:47,488
Allow me to demonstrate.

228
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,459
Are those liquor bottles?

229
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:50,620
I brought plenty.

230
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:53,927
Take those to
the teachers' lounge.

231
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:01,504
Hey, Bernard!

232
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:02,938
Good evening,
Krusty.

233
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,839
Nice to see you,
Bernard.

234
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,241
Thank you very much.

235
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,803
- Krusty, over here!
- Krusty, one more!

236
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:19,856
Henceforth, this date
shall forever be known

237
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,517
as Flaming Moe's Day.

238
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,356
Sir, this is Veteran's Day.

239
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:24,726
It can be two things.

240
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,967
Mom, instead of milk,
can I have a virgin Moe?

241
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,472
Honey, what's wrong?

242
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,034
I'll tell you what.

243
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:43,639
<i>That rotten Moe is getting rich
off a recipe I gave him.</i>

244
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,977
Take that off
this second.

245
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:50,043
Okay.

246
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:52,249
Homey, why don't you go
to Moe's

247
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:53,518
and talk to him?

248
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:56,652
I bet he'd share some
of his success with you.

249
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:57,821
Nah.

250
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,955
Marge, I'm too upset to eat.

251
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:02,091
I think I'll go to Moe's.

252
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:03,099
D'oh!

253
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,660
Oh!

254
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,400
Hey!

255
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:09,406
Can I help you?

256
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:10,669
I need to see Moe.

257
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,506
Your name's
not on the list.

258
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:13,510
I never gave it.

259
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,171
What is it?
Homer Simpson.

260
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,214
Not on the list.

261
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:18,181
We're all filled up.

262
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,444
File off!.

263
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:22,510
Some new buddies of mine
stopped by tonight.

264
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,216
Maybe we can get them
to come up here.

265
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,521
How about a warm
Flaming Moe's welcome for...

266
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,186
Aerosmith!

267
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:33,231
Nah. We're just
hanging out.

268
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:35,163
Come on. Free pickled eggs.

269
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,030
- All right!
- Yeah!

270
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,129
Hello, St. Louis!

271
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,969
That's Springfield,
Steven.

272
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,134
Oh, yeah. Right.

273
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,767
Are you ready to rock?

274
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,402
Yeah!

275
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,811
I said, are you ready to rock!

276
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,349
Yeah!

277
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,351
Hit it!

278
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,771
Barney?

279
00:13:16,842 --> 00:13:17,831
Hi, Homer.

280
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,844
I want you
to meet my friends

281
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,379
Armando and Raffi.

282
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,854
Hey, Moe, come on.
Get up here.

283
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:46,967
Do you want to ignite
my drink?

284
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,631
You're my kid's teacher.

285
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,140
Single parent, are we?

286
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,141
No.

287
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,474
Let's pretend you are.

288
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:54,739
Get away from me.

289
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:55,837
Hey, Moe!

290
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:57,609
Homer, how about a beer?

291
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,878
<i>I'd rather have
a Flaming Homer.</i>

292
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:00,976
A what?

293
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:02,350
Oh, I get it.

294
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,651
How could you
do this to me?

295
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:08,352
This bar was going under,
and my drink saved it.

296
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:12,454
<i>My face should be on
that crappy merchandise.</i>

297
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:14,658
Morris, is what
this man says true?

298
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:15,859
It's hard to say.

299
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:18,198
<i>He may have come up
with the recipe</i>

300
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,738
but I came up
with the idea

301
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:22,034
of charging 6.95.

302
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,040
Uhp-- telephone.

303
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,508
Flaming Moe's.

304
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:26,976
I'm looking for a friend.

305
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,343
Last name:Jazz.
First name: Hugh.

306
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:30,676
Hold on. I'll check.

307
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:31,977
Huge ass?

308
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,178
Somebody check the men's room
for a huge ass.

309
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:36,346
I'm Hugh Jazz.

310
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:37,353
Telephone.

311
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:38,582
This is Hugh Jazz.

312
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:39,783
Uh... hi.

313
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:40,916
Who's this?

314
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:41,925
Bart Simpson.

315
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,256
What can I do for you?

316
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:45,796
This is a crank call
that backfired

317
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,355
and I'd like to bail out
right now.

318
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,957
Better luck next time.

319
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:51,866
Hmm, what a nice young man.

320
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:54,838
I'm sorry you're mad,
but this isn't personal.

321
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,135
This is business.

322
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,300
Business, eh?

323
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:59,867
Well, you just lost yourself
a customer.

324
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:02,038
What? I couldn't hear you.

325
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:04,708
I said,
you just lost a customer!

326
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:07,115
- What?
- You just lost a customer!

327
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:08,619
You'll have to speak up.

328
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:11,053
You lost yourself
a customer, Moe!

329
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:13,614
I forced myself to what?

330
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,319
You just lost
a customer!

331
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:16,656
We'll talk tomorrow.

332
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:19,219
You just lost yourself
a customer!

333
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:20,560
Yeah, you can use it.

334
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,743
Barney!

335
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,644
How's the world treating you?

336
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,845
Hey, there!

337
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,852
What can I do
for you, Harv?

338
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,411
Tipsy McStagger would like
to buy your drink.

339
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,784
He's here?

340
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,292
No. My company is willing
to do what it takes

341
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,919
to get that recipe.

342
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,931
We're prepared
to offer you $1 million.

343
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,264
Sorry, Harv,
but like I told you before

344
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,928
it ain't for sale.

345
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,097
Don't be stupid!

346
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:49,605
We have a lab for this.

347
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:52,541
We've figured it out,
except for one ingredient.

348
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,100
<i>Brace yourselves, gentlemen.</i>

349
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:57,204
According
to the gas chromatograph

350
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,546
the secret ingredient is...

351
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:00,948
love?!

352
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,112
Who's been screwing
with this thing?

353
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:05,917
I'm sorry, but the secret
ingredient dies with me.

354
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,288
30 cases of cough syrup.

355
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,020
- Sign here.

356
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:12,028
I got hooked on this
in the service.

357
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:16,726
Ah! My new watering hole.

358
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,428
Yeah, what do you want?!

359
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:21,802
A beer.

360
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:22,805
Okay, then.

361
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,544
<i>Can I have a clean glass?</i>

362
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,780
Here you go,
Your Majesty.

363
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,578
<i>Next on Eye on Springfield</i>

364
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,778
a toast to Moe,
wizard of Walnut Street.

365
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:39,084
The Flaming Moe
dates back to my forefathers

366
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,250
who were bartenders to the czar.

367
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,090
So, Mr. Hutz,
does my husband have a case?

368
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,823
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Simpson

369
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,990
but you can't
copyright a drink.

370
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,260
Ohh!

371
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,167
This goes back to the '7 8
Frank Wallbanger case.

372
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:53,328
How about that?

373
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:54,996
I looked something up.

374
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:57,837
These books don't just make
the office look good.

375
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:00,173
They're filled
with useful legal tidbits.

376
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,404
Stupid Moe.

377
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,845
Non-inventing,
recipe-stealing, pug-nosed...

378
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,849
maybe you can take consolation

379
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,748
in that something you created

380
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:16,419
I'm the magical man
from happy land

381
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:20,191
in a gumdrop house
on lollipop lane.

382
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,363
Oh, by the way,
I was being sarcastic.

383
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:26,027
Well, duh!

384
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:29,369
Now, that's what I call
a happy hour.

385
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,370
Morris, something troubles me.

386
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:35,640
My mother won't be home
for another 20 minutes.

387
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:38,273
No. I was thinking
about Homer Simpson.

388
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:39,316
That's okay.

389
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,614
I was thinking
about Sybil Danning.

390
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:44,120
I meant, I think you
should sell your drink

391
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,213
and give half the money
to Homer.

392
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,257
But, honey...

393
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,088
He's your friend, Morris

394
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,060
and you took advantage
of him.

395
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,153
All right.
All right.

396
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,164
I'll split the million
with Homer.

397
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:55,665
Jeepers, Mary and Joseph!

398
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,325
I sleep with a chick once

399
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,700
it costs me
half a million bananas.

400
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,569
Moe, Moe, Moe...

401
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,165
Bart, are you going
to mow the lawn today?

402
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,803
Okay, but you promised me
Moe money.

403
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:09,107
I Moe, I Moe.

404
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,774
Moe, Moe, Moe...

405
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,783
When Bart's done,
can we Moe

406
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,876
to the Moevies
for the Moetinee?

407
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:19,946
Of course. All work and Moe play
makes Moe a Moe Moe.

408
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:20,752
Moe Moe Moe Moe Moe?

409
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:21,484
Moe Moe Moe.

410
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,548
Moe Moe Moe Moe Moe.

411
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:23,457
Moe Moe Moe Moe.

412
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,062
Moe.

413
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:29,531
Moe, Moe...

414
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,862
Moe...

415
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:33,130
Moe, Moe...

416
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:34,796
Moe....

417
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:36,863
Moe, Moe...

418
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,033
Hey, Homer.

419
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,201
Hey, Homer.

420
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,505
Hey, Homer.

421
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:41,670
Hey, Homer.

422
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,338
- Hey, Homer.
- Hey, Homer.

423
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,006
Hey, Homer.

424
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,141
- Hey, Homer.
- Hey, Homer.

425
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,650
Aaaaahh!

426
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,016
<i>- Hey, Homer.
- Hey, Homer.</i>

427
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,145
<i>Hiya, Homer!</i>

428
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:52,155
<i>What's the matter?</i>

429
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:53,485
Aaaaaaahhh!

430
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,225
Hey, where's Joey?

431
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,095
<i>[Joey ]
Mrs. Krabappel</i>

432
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,327
I really need
my drumsticks.

433
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,495
Come and get 'em!

434
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,732
You're going to be
a rich man, Moe.

435
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:12,037
The way we usually work
is to steal the recipe

436
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,668
and run the inventor

437
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,007
out of business.

438
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,047
<i>Ah, c'est la vie.</i>

439
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,746
What the..?

440
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:23,849
Fools!

441
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:25,081
You poor, pathetic

442
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:26,248
misguided creatures

443
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:27,848
choking down Flaming Moes

444
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,860
all the time wondering,
'' How does he do it?''

445
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:33,192
Well, I'm going to tell you.

446
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:34,424
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

447
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,262
The secret ingredient is...

448
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,426
Homer, no!

449
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,766
...Cough syrup.

450
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:42,362
Nothing but plain, ordinary,
over-the-counter

451
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,203
children's cough syrup.

452
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:47,776
Shoot.

453
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,437
Thank you, Mr. Nutball.

454
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,414
Got to go, Moe.
Tough luck.

455
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,377
Aaaaaaaahhh!

456
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,215
Holy cow,
you just fell

457
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,811
on Aerosmith!

458
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,597
Hey, Homer.

459
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:10,861
Come in here.

460
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:12,027
Hi, Moe.

461
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:13,502
Where's your waitress?

462
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:15,698
She left to pursue
a movie career.

463
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:19,436
Frankly, I think she
was better off here.

464
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,911
Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

465
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,242
Oh, hey, hey.

466
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:27,079
Maybe some things are too good
to be kept a secret.

467
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,083
I guess so.

468
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,744
Compliments of the house--

469
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,483
One Flaming... Homer.

470
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,321
<i>Aw, thanks, Moe.</i>

471
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:38,328
<i>You're the greatest friend
a guy could ever have.</i>

472
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:41,331
<i>Hey, do you think Aerosmith
will be in tonight?</i>

473
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:43,094
<i>I doubt it.</i>

474
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:52,337
- Shh!
