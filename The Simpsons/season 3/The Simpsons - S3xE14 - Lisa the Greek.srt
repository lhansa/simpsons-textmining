00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:07,393
<i>####Ahh, the Simpsons</i>

2
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:12,602
D'oh!

3
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:37,503
Bret Councilman here...

4
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:40,272
on week eight
of the N.F.L. season.

5
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:44,213
Now stay tuned for six hours
of exciting football action.

6
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:45,716
Well, bye-bye belt.

7
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:58,760
Homer, all those fatty...

8
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,298
deep-fried,
heavily-salted snacks...

9
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,630
can't be good
for your heart.

10
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,897
My heart is just fine.

11
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:15,141
A little beer
will put out that fire.

12
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,477
Now with the specs
for today's games...

13
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,709
the man who's right...

14
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:21,878
52% of the time,
Smooth Jimmy Apollo.

15
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:25,150
Our first game today,
Denver and New England...

16
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:26,656
is too close to call.

17
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:27,749
Oh...

18
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:29,987
But if you're
the compulsive type...

19
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:31,222
who just has to bet...

20
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:32,991
Well, I don't know.

21
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:34,589
Mmm... Denver!

22
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,655
Woo-whoo!

23
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,224
Denver! Yeah!

24
00:01:37,302 --> 00:01:38,326
Moe's Tavern...

25
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:40,667
where the peanut bowl
is freshened hourly.

26
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,401
Moe, I'd like to bet $20
on Denver.

27
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:45,670
I think I can provide
that service.

28
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:47,678
Chief Wiggum,
could you hand me...

29
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:49,338
that little black book?

30
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:50,381
Sure thing, Moe.

31
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:52,417
I was using it
as a coaster.

32
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:53,712
$20 on Denver.

33
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:55,719
Pleasure doing business...

34
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:57,379
H.S.

35
00:01:57,456 --> 00:02:00,289
All right, Denver,
justify my love.

36
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,951
At the end of 1 3 seconds...

37
00:02:02,027 --> 00:02:04,621
it's New England seven,
Denver nothing.

38
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:05,628
D'oh!

39
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:06,686
Look, Dad.

40
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,130
I made an apartment...

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,963
for my Malibu Stacy doll.

42
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:11,297
This is a kitchen.

43
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,703
This is where she prints
her feminist newsletter.

44
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:17,207
Dad, you're not listening to me!

45
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,300
Lousy, stupid Denver.

46
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,039
Mmm!

47
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:26,480
Oh, look at that,
a shoe box house.

48
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,485
Lisa, you're so clever.

49
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:30,544
Why isn't Dad
interested...

50
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:31,987
in anything I do?

51
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:35,515
Do you ever take an interest
in anything he does?

52
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:38,654
No... Well, we used
to have burping contests...

53
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,027
but I outgrew it.

54
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:42,157
If you want to get closer
to him...

55
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,293
maybe you should bridge the gap.

56
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:45,836
I do it all the time.

57
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:48,668
I pretend
I'm interested in power tools...

58
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,799
going to silly
car-chase movies...

59
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:53,811
and things I'll tell you
when you're older.

60
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,176
Do you understand?

61
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:56,509
I think so.

62
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,173
- Bart!
- What?

63
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,275
Oh, look at that.

64
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:01,785
Why did you do that?

65
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:03,115
Wouldn't it be fun...

66
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:05,452
if we watched the game
together?

67
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:06,786
Uh...

68
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,120
okay.

69
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:11,458
Just don't say anything,
and sit down over there.

70
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,622
Over.

71
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:13,959
Over.

72
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:16,125
Over.

73
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,634
Over.

74
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:21,301
Lisa, I can't hear
the announcer.

75
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:23,307
He said
Denver fumbled.

76
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,342
D'oh!

77
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,303
See you in hell, soldier boy.

78
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:32,611
- Bart?
- Yeah, Mom?

79
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:35,312
While your father and Lisa
watch the game...

80
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:37,947
it might be fun
if we went clothes shopping.

81
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:41,186
Mom, I'd love to,
but I don't need new clothes.

82
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,749
Oh, really?

83
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,659
Even though
I'd love to spend...

84
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:51,463
this sunny afternoon
trying on clothes, it's not...

85
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:54,937
Folks, when you're right
52% of the time...

86
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:57,372
you're wrong 48% of the time.

87
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:59,034
Why didn't you
say that before?!

88
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,941
Okay, you're off the hook.

89
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:03,037
Any thoughts
on Miami-Cincinnati?

90
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,672
I certainly do, Bret.

91
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:06,341
I hereby declare Miami...

92
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:09,444
to be Smooth Jimmy's
'Lock of the Week.'

93
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:11,113
Ooh, that's a big lock.

94
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:13,214
I just don't trust that guy.

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,956
In the Cincinnati-Miami game...

96
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:19,394
I declare Cincinnati
my 'Shoe-in of the Week.'

97
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,432
They both make a good case.

98
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,465
After evaluating
millions of pieces of data...

99
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:27,129
in the blink of an eye...

100
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:30,971
the Gamble-Tron 2000 says
the winner is... Cincinnati...

101
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,135
by 200 points?!

102
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:35,805
Why, you worthless hunk of junk!

103
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,347
- You want this, don't you?
- Yeah!

104
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,477
You need the winners,
and I know them.

105
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:44,078
So call me now.

106
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:47,386
$5 for the first minute,
$2 for additional minutes.

107
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:51,357
You... have reached...

108
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:52,589
the Coach's...

109
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:53,596
Hot...

110
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:54,597
Line.

111
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,598
line.

112
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,100
Lay it on me, Coach.

113
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,760
In the game of...

114
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:00,099
Mi-am-i...

115
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:01,103
Mm-hmm.

116
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,104
versus Cin...

117
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,105
Cincinnati.

118
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:04,436
- cin...
- Cincinnati.

119
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,601
- na...
- Cincinnati.

120
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:06,837
- ti...
- Come on!

121
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:09,608
Don't you realize
this is costing me money?

122
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,774
we must consider... many things.

123
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,181
The wind...

124
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:14,616
D'oh, not the wind!

125
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,278
is blowing out of the...

126
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,446
west...

127
00:05:17,522 --> 00:05:18,614
at five...

128
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,952
Miles per hour.

129
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,117
knots.

130
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,454
This is ridiculous!

131
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,961
Lisa, who do you think
will win--

132
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,294
the Bengals or the Dolphins?

133
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:28,457
I don't know.

134
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,795
The Dolphins?

135
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:30,960
Good, good.

136
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:33,470
Moe, $50
on the Miami Dolphins.

137
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:35,130
50 beans on Miami.

138
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,697
Homer, I got a call
on the other line.

139
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,403
It's me, Mr. K.

140
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,703
What will it be?

141
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,805
Put me down for $7 00
on the Rams.

142
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,884
Put Sideshow down
for two grand.

143
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:48,146
Mom, I'm tired.

144
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,811
I want to go home.

145
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:52,652
Can't I just lie down
for a minute?

146
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,988
Bart, I think
you'd look very sharp...

147
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,084
in this shirt.

148
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:57,822
<i>Fine. Get it. Let's go.</i>

149
00:05:57,896 --> 00:05:58,885
No, no, no.

150
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:00,329
You have to try it on.

151
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:02,992
Ooh, this one's 50% off.

152
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:07,061
That's because people
who wear them get beaten up.

153
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:10,904
Well, anyone who would do that
isn't your friend.

154
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:12,000
This looks good...

155
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:14,272
and this one
is very, very cute...

156
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:15,973
and these...

157
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,538
Oh, look, little bow ties!

158
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:21,108
And don't make
that face at me.

159
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:22,448
How did you know?

160
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,613
Touchdown, Dolphins!

161
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:25,951
All right, Dolphins!

162
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:27,321
All right, Dolphins!

163
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:28,051
Whoo-hoo!

164
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,218
Whoo-hoo!

165
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:30,818
50 big ones!

166
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:32,089
50 big ones?

167
00:06:32,163 --> 00:06:33,130
Uh-oh.

168
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:34,961
Daddy's friend Moe promised...

169
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:37,900
to give him $50
if the Dolphins won.

170
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:38,993
You made a bet?

171
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,628
I wouldn't call it a bet.

172
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,468
It's a little thing
daddies do...

173
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,474
to make football
more exciting.

174
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,305
What could
be more exciting...

175
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:48,869
than the savage ballet
of pro football?

176
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:50,141
Well, you know.

177
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:52,479
You like ice cream,
don't you?

178
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,484
Don't you like
ice cream better...

179
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:56,543
when it's covered
with hot fudge...

180
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:59,522
and mounds of whipped cream,
chopped nuts...

181
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:02,754
and those crumbled-up
cookie things they mash up?

182
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:03,987
Mmm...

183
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:05,996
crumbled-up cookie things.

184
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:08,726
So gambling makes a good thing
even better?

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,767
That's right!

186
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,062
My God...

187
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:14,128
it's like there's
some kind of bond between us.

188
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,008
Hmm?

189
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,737
Mm-hmm.

190
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:33,286
We've got a troublemaker
in booth eight.

191
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:35,588
There's a code red
in booth three.

192
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,592
My God!

193
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:38,253
Those aren't the socks...

194
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,263
she came in with.

195
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:41,457
Let's move.

196
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:45,594
- Bart?
- In here, Mom.

197
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,602
Don't open...

198
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:52,035
You could use
some new underwear too.

199
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,011
Look at that stupid kid!

200
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,240
- Three!
- Three!

201
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:57,406
- Two!
- Two!

202
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:58,574
- One!
- One!

203
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,414
And the final
from Riverfront Stadium:

204
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,920
Miami 2 4, Cincinnati 1 0.

205
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:05,012
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

206
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,923
Mom sure will be happy
you won $50.

207
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:09,084
You'd think that...

208
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,594
but your mother
has this crazy idea...

209
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:13,096
that gambling is wrong...

210
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:16,258
even though they say it's okay
in the Bible.

211
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,528
Really? Where?

212
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:19,433
Uh... somewhere in the back.

213
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:22,098
The point is,
we had a great time today.

214
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:23,606
To keep it that way...

215
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:27,441
let's not tell your mother
about our little wager, okay?

216
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:28,444
Okay, Dad.

217
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,844
Did you two
have fun?

218
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:31,108
You bet.

219
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,610
We had fun too.

220
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:35,949
Bart is modeling
his new clothes...

221
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,248
for his friends.

222
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:39,119
Ooh...

223
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,125
You got to come out sometime,
Simpson.

224
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:52,294
- Good night, Dad.
I had a nice time today.
- Me too, honey.

225
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,860
Can I watch football
with you again next Sunday?

226
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:55,200
Sure. It gets rid...

227
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,798
of the unpleasant aftertaste
of church.

228
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,638
See how good things happen...

229
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,644
if you make
a little effort?

230
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:04,078
Point well taken.
Could you loosen my blanket a little?

231
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:07,117
Dad tucked me in too tight,
and it's cutting off...

232
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,745
the circulation
in my arms and legs.

233
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:12,346
This team is fired up.

234
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:13,685
- All right!
- He'll lose.

235
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,022
What? Didn't you hear
what he said?

236
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:19,358
The fear in his eyes,
the quiver in his voice.

237
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,399
He's a little boy
lost in a game of men.

238
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,058
Should we bet
against them?

239
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:26,399
I'd bet my entire
college fund on it.

240
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,735
Moe, $23 on New York.

241
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,707
Start spreading
the news.

242
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:34,711
It's New York
over Philadelphia, 3 5 to 1 0.

243
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,041
- Yay!
- Yay!

244
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:39,048
Dad, I hate
to break the mood...

245
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:41,311
but I'm
getting nauseous.

246
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:42,647
Oh, sorry.

247
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,156
So, who do you like
in the afternoon games?

248
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,488
The 49ers
because they're pure of heart...

249
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,153
Seattle because they got
something to prove...

250
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:53,356
and the Raiders
because they cheat.

251
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,991
In an extremely suspicious play...

252
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,329
the Raiders win!

253
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:58,732
Three for three!

254
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,936
Hey, the new sign's
really working.

255
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:09,343
It's been
a madhouse, Lisa.

256
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:10,607
Let's see...

257
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,706
football... football...

258
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:14,717
<i>Homoeroticism in...</i>

259
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:16,719
<i>Oddball Canadian Rules...</i>

260
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,721
<i>Phyllis George in...</i>

261
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,381
Oh, doctor,
what a finish!

262
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,359
The final score--
Atlanta 1 7, Houston 1 3.

263
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:25,361
The lowly Falcons
are flying high.

264
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,363
Who would have thunk it?

265
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:28,864
My daughter, that's who.

266
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,195
Yeah, me.

267
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:32,202
You pick the winner
every time.

268
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,864
You must have some kind
of special gift.

269
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:36,531
It doesn't take a genius...

270
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:39,542
to realize Houston's failed
to cover their last ten outings...

271
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,204
the week after scoring
three touchdowns...

272
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,304
in a game.

273
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,316
My little girl
says the cutest things.

274
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:48,477
Dad, Sunday
is fast becoming...

275
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:50,645
my favorite day
of the week.

276
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:53,884
Not Sunday--
Daddy-Daughter Day.

277
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,222
The usual, Moe--

278
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:58,660
a beer...
and a wad of bills!

279
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:00,162
Okay...

280
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:02,961
you lucky moron.

281
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,561
Here you go, Homer, $1 3 5.

282
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,904
I used to hate the smell
of your sweaty feet.

283
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:14,240
Now it's the smell
of victory.

284
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:15,836
Oh, shut up.

285
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,239
Look at these prices!
We could finally get rid...

286
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:22,718
of those termites
for the cost of this meal.

287
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:25,255
Tut-tut,
only the best for my family.

288
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:28,156
I wonder where
you're getting the money.

289
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:31,160
Can't a man do something
nice for his loved ones?

290
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,490
I guess so.

291
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:36,030
Hello, I'm Marco,
I'll be your waiter.

292
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,568
I'm Homer,
I'll be your customer.

293
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:42,097
Never heard that one before.

294
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:44,437
Would you care
to select the wine?

295
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:46,169
I'll do the honors.

296
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:47,767
No, no, no, no.

297
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,676
My God!

298
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:52,272
What passes for a wine list
these days?

299
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,682
Just bring us your freshest
bottle of wine.

300
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:56,686
Chop, chop.

301
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:58,847
Charming lad.

302
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:01,892
Oh, violin guy.

303
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,393
What's your favorite song,
Lisa?

304
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:06,555
''The Broken Neck Blues.''

305
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,722
Play on.

306
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:16,568
It is the play-offs.

307
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,005
It's five below.

308
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:20,407
One fan's wearing
a G-string...

309
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,742
and the team colors on his body.

310
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,407
Maybe the paint has shut off
his pores...

311
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,246
and he's slowly suffocating.

312
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,252
<i>That is a real fan.</i>

313
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,912
It's Daddy-Daughter Day...

314
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:32,751
and Daddy needs
daughter's picks.

315
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:36,554
The Chiefs are my five star,
silver bullet special.

316
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:40,495
With your blessing, I'd like
to tie it to the Cowboys...

317
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:42,293
plus five at Chicago.

318
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:43,765
You call Moe.

319
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,098
Moe, this is L.S.
calling for H.S.

320
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,330
Just bet, Lisa.

321
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:48,929
1 1 0, 1 20...

322
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:50,940
You lucky son of a...

323
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,635
Want to go bowling
Sunday?

324
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,974
Are you nuts?
That's the Super Bowl.

325
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,139
How about the Sunday
after that?

326
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:58,977
Ma's coming in
from Norway...

327
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,312
but what the hell.

328
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:02,916
<i>When the doctor said...</i>

329
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:05,751
I didn't have worms anymore,
that was the happiest day...

330
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:07,552
of my life.

331
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,855
Thank you, Ralph,
very graphic.

332
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:12,862
Lisa Simpson, would you like
to read your essay?

333
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,525
The happiest day of my life
was three Sundays ago...

334
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,535
when the Saints--
four and a half point favorites...

335
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:20,865
only up by three--

336
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:23,133
kicked a meaningless field goal...

337
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,641
at the last second
to cover the spread.

338
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,040
Dear God!

339
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:28,635
You must have bought me...

340
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:30,942
every Malibu Stacy accessory.

341
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,141
Not quite.

342
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:35,117
They were out
of Malibu Stacy lunar rovers.

343
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:37,620
Ooh, perfume!

344
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:39,747
'' Meryl Streep's Versatility.''

345
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:48,063
I know you're going
to like your present.

346
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:50,327
Shut up! Shut up!
Kiss my butt!

347
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:51,425
Go to hell!

348
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:52,628
Dad, I promise...

349
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:55,501
<i>I will never get tired of this.</i>

350
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,336
Those were
very thoughtful presents...

351
00:13:57,408 --> 00:14:00,844
but you have to tell me
where you got the money.

352
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:03,311
You have to promise
you won't get mad.

353
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,972
I promise I will.

354
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:08,485
I always do when you
make me promise I won't.

355
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:11,487
Lisa and I have been gambling
on pro football.

356
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:12,522
Homer!

357
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,319
You promised
you wouldn't get mad.

358
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:15,949
I promised I would!

359
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:17,618
She's eight years old!

360
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:19,287
Marge, she's got a gift.

361
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:21,695
Aren't parents supposed
to encourage their kids...

362
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:23,699
whenever they show talent?

363
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,530
Gambling is illegal.

364
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,537
Only in 48 states.

365
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,539
Besides,
it's a victimless crime.

366
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,165
The only victim is Moe...

367
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:33,802
and it's brought
Lisa and me together.

368
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:35,140
I just don't know.

369
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:36,679
What's the problem?

370
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:39,614
The kids are happy,
you smell like Meryl Streep...

371
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:42,652
and I got that foot massager
I've always wanted.

372
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,315
Believe me, Marge, nothing bad
could possibly come of this.

373
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,652
You know, Dad...

374
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:50,489
we've been watching
a lot ofTV lately.

375
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,495
Maybe the Sunday
after the Super Bowl...

376
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:54,497
we could climb
Mt. Springfield.

377
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:57,398
The fires in the tire yards
make beautiful sunsets.

378
00:14:57,468 --> 00:15:00,733
Next Sunday
I'm going bowling with Barney.

379
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:02,499
What about
Daddy-Daughter Day?!

380
00:15:02,573 --> 00:15:05,736
The new football season
is only seven months away.

381
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,174
So that's it.

382
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,838
You just wanted me
to help you gamble.

383
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:12,974
You never wanted
to be with me at all.

384
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:17,486
You're a very selfish man.

385
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:19,147
Go to hell!
Go to hell!

386
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:21,919
Hey, once again,
great present, Dad.

387
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,796
Uh... uh...

388
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:33,398
My third husband bought me this.

389
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,338
Give me some chips for it.

390
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:36,534
Are you sure?

391
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,406
Don't tell me what to do.

392
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,537
I've been gambling
since I was eight...

393
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:42,444
and hocking jewelry
since I was 1 2.

394
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:43,641
Give me chips.

395
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:51,890
Look around you, Malibu Stacy.

396
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,358
All this was bought
with dirty money.

397
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:58,124
Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo,
your collagen-injection clinic.

398
00:15:58,198 --> 00:15:59,495
Back into the box.

399
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:01,431
It may not be pretty...

400
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,696
but damn it, it's honest.

401
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,974
I, Lisa Simpson...

402
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,805
am hereby giving away...

403
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:15,177
all my ill-gotten
Malibu Stacy accessories!

404
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:18,111
Ahh!

405
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,625
Look, I bought you...

406
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,526
a Malibu Stacy
chinchilla coat.

407
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:31,962
Huh?

408
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:34,158
You've come to buy
my forgiveness.

409
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,360
Sorry, Homer.

410
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:36,800
Lisa, honey,
I'm sorry...

411
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,772
but I really had a good time
watching football with you...

412
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,139
and I think you had
a good time with me.

413
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,905
Yeah, I did.

414
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,709
We can still watch
the Super Bowl together...

415
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:49,908
can't we?

416
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:54,583
Well, I would like to see
what the fuss is about.

417
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:55,746
It's a date.

418
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:56,948
So...

419
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:58,957
do you think the Redskins...

420
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,549
will beat the spread?

421
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:02,060
Put me down.

422
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,494
I'll tell you
who's going to win...

423
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,896
but it will just
validate my theory...

424
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:09,696
that you cared more
about winning money...

425
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,600
than you did about me.

426
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,571
Okay.

427
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,108
I think Washington
is a mortal lock.

428
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:17,973
Washington!
Whoo-hoo!

429
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:19,170
However...

430
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:20,371
What however?

431
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,743
However what?

432
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:25,114
However, I may also be
so clouded with rage...

433
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:26,584
that subconsciously...

434
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:27,984
I want you to lose.

435
00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:31,512
In which case,
I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.

436
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:32,717
Do me a favor.

437
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:33,918
Complete this sentence:

438
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:36,359
Daddy should bet
all his money on...

439
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:37,691
I don't know.

440
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:38,423
D'oh!

441
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:39,965
If I still love you...

442
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,159
Washington.

443
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,861
If I don't, Buffalo.

444
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:50,598
Homer, I think that chip's
got enough dip on it.

445
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:55,475
We're live from
the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome...

446
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,674
and Super Bowl 26.

447
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:58,808
Today we're going to be seen...

448
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:02,252
by people in 1 50 countries
all over the world...

449
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:05,223
including our newest affiliate,
W-Gimel-Aleph-Nun...

450
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,417
in Tel Aviv.

451
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:07,618
<i>Stupid!</i>

452
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,059
<i>Formidable.</i>

453
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:23,008
Every note is a dagger
in my heart.

454
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,067
I got to get out of here.

455
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:26,270
Moe's Tavern...

456
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,576
home of the Super Sunday
Brunch Spectacular.

457
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:30,343
Ohh! Baloney.

458
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,077
Bread!

459
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:34,085
Got you down for 40 bucks.

460
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:35,677
Good luck, Your Eminence.

461
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:37,723
You can't take
more of my money.

462
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,384
I'm out
of the bookie business.

463
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,325
But Moe,
you've been taking bets all...

464
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:44,386
Barney, have a free beer.

465
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:45,328
Wow!

466
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,059
Don't worry, I'm not betting.

467
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:47,827
What?

468
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:49,732
- Give me that.
- Aw.

469
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,736
I had the greatest gift
of all--

470
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:54,102
a little girl who
could pick football...

471
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,504
and I ruined it.

472
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:59,102
We're two hours and 45 minutes
through the pregame show.

473
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,702
Our guest is Troy McClure...

474
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,907
whose new sitcom
premiers tonight...

475
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:05,007
right after the game!

476
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:06,244
Thanks, Bret.

477
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,617
<i>My new show's called
Handle With Care.</i>

478
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,622
I playJack Handle,
a retired cop...

479
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,885
who shares an apartment
with a retired criminal.

480
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,586
The original odd couple.

481
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:17,858
I fell in love
with the script, Bret...

482
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:21,662
and my recent trouble
with the I RS sealed the deal.

483
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:22,860
That's great, Troy.

484
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:24,233
Ooh! Looks like...

485
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:26,568
we're almost ready
for the kickoff.

486
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:27,765
Washington kicks.

487
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
Oh, it's a bad kick,
way too short.

488
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:32,410
Buffalo starts
in excellent position.

489
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:34,446
Buffalo's going to win.

490
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:35,606
Lisa hates me.

491
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:37,445
What did you bet?

492
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:38,814
My daughter.

493
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,316
What a gambler.

494
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:45,517
And with the score at the half
Buffalo 1 4, Washington 7...

495
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:49,687
it's time for the never-tedious
Super Bowl halftime show.

496
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:55,325
People of Earth, we've come
ten billion light-years...

497
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:59,895
to bring you this
halftime message of peace.

498
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:11,642
Oh, this sucks.

499
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,050
Come on, snipers,
where are you?

500
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,246
Bart, who's winning?

501
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:17,619
You-Hate-Dad
by a touchdown.

502
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:21,818
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go! Yay!!</i>

503
00:20:21,894 --> 00:20:25,159
Announcer:
...for halfback Dan Beerdorf.

504
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:28,098
Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl.

505
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,502
They wanted it more.

506
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:33,095
Homer, didn't you say
if Duff Dry wins...

507
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:35,106
your daughter loves you?

508
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:36,698
Not Duff Dry,
Washington.

509
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,301
Okay, okay, they're
both great teams.

510
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:40,505
- Yay!
- Yay!

511
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,842
Huh?

512
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:43,643
Touchdown, Redskins.

513
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:45,741
All right,
we're back in business.

514
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:49,584
Well, I'm glad some people...

515
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:52,488
could resist the lures
of the big game.

516
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:53,820
I forgot the game!

517
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:56,760
It all comes down
to this one play.

518
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:00,265
If Washington scores,
happy fans will be looting...

519
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,427
and turning over cars
in our nation's capital tonight.

520
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:04,527
Please, please, please.

521
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:05,593
Touchdown!

522
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:08,067
It is done.

523
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,008
The Washington Redskins
win Super Bowl 26!

524
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:12,135
You love Dad.

525
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:14,008
I suspected as much.

526
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,571
Yes! She loves me,
she loves me.

527
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,173
Why are you so happy?

528
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,582
You didn't win money.

529
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:22,746
Money comes and goes,
but my daughter and I...

530
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:25,313
can go on
for eight more years!

531
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,386
Come on, Dad!

532
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:37,728
It's... beautiful.

533
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:39,032
Isn't it, though?

534
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:41,767
After I... catch my...
breath...

535
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:46,278
can we...
go... home?
