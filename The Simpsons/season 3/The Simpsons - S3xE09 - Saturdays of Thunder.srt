<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,390
D'oh!

3
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,219
Products you could only imagine before.

4
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,263
The Foam Dome.

00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,662
TheJet Walker.

6
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,667
Mr. Sugar Cube.

7
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,570
That baby changed our lives.

8
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:43,173
I'm actor Troy McClure.

9
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:45,337
You might remember me
from such TV series as...

10
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,472
<i>Buck Henderson, Union Buster...</i>

11
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:50,642
<i>and Troy and Company's
Summertime Smile Factory...</i>

12
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:52,982
but I'm here to tell you
about Spiffy...

13
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,284
the 21 st century stain remover.

14
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:58,086
Let's meet the inventor--
Dr. Nick Riviera.

15
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,354
Thank you, Troy.
Hi, everybody.

16
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:02,123
Hi, Dr. Nick.

17
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:04,357
Troy, I brought with me
the gravestone...

18
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:07,595
of author and troubled soul,
Edgar Allan Poe.

19
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,103
One of our best writers.

20
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,196
Yes, but unfortunately
a century of neglect...

21
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:15,936
has turned this tombstone
into a depressing eyesore.

22
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,910
I guess we're gonna have to
throw it away.

23
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,640
Not so fast, Troy.

24
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:21,909
With one application of Spiffy...

25
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:25,282
you'll think the body's
still warm.

26
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,287
Ooh!

27
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,788
Ahh!

28
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:31,723
''Quoth the raven--''
What a shine!

29
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:34,626
Ooh! That's one clean tombstone.

30
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,665
- Dad, you got a power drill?
- In the garage.

31
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:39,393
I'm offering three bottles--

32
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,901
enough to clean 1 ,000 tombstones--

33
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,303
for only $39.95.

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,567
Boo!

35
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:50,406
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to do better, Doctor.

36
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:52,742
Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.

37
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:57,751
But how can I make it lower than $39.95?

38
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,446
Find a way.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,579
I can't find the safety goggles
for the power saw.

40
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:04,625
- If stuff starts flying
just turn your head.
- Check.

41
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:07,160
Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle...

42
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,718
the applicator glove...

43
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:11,356
and a state of Kansas
Jell-O mold--

44
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,992
$29.95.

45
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,536
- D'oh! D'oh!

46
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:20,540
Okay. Okay, calm down.

47
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:23,839
Homer, can you get the door?
It's my sisters.

48
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:28,510
- Homer, be nice.
- Okay, I will. I will.

49
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,574
Coming over here--

50
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:33,916
Patty, Thelma,
what a pleasant surprise!

51
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,422
What do you know.
He's wearing pants.

52
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,822
I owe you lunch.

53
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:40,224
Ugly.

54
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:43,024
Ugly. Butch.

55
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,726
What's the matter?
Can't you find a hairstyle you like?

56
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:49,861
Hold the phone.
That's the one for me.

57
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:52,872
- Ed Asner?
- No, next to him.

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,704
Mary Tyler Moore.

59
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,744
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:59,541
Expiration date,June 1 989...

61
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,845
uh, 201 2, yeah.

62
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:05,681
Homer, are you ordering junk
off the TV again?

63
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,721
Shh! They'll hear you.

64
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,155
Oh, who's using the power tools?

65
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,818
I don't know.
Some guy, I guess.

66
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:16,796
We're going to the beauty parlor.
You should do something
with the kids while I'm gone.

67
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:18,832
Oh, sure, great idea.

68
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,391
I'd love to.
D'oh! Did you hear that?

69
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,061
- Yes.
- How much?

70
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,800
- Everything.
- What's the quickest, easiest way
to do something with you?

71
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:28,739
Take us to the video store?

72
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,778
Anything for my little girl.

73
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,137
Bart!

74
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:37,776
You can't weld
with such a little flame.

75
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,410
Stupid kid.

76
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,954
<i>Ooh! McBain.</i>

77
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,430
Mm-mm-mm.

78
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,560
McBain, you keep eating them hot links
you never gonna make it to a pension.

79
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:58,400
- Come on, live a little.
- No, thank you.

80
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:01,408
I got me a future.
I'm two days away from retirement.

81
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:03,410
My daughter's graduating
from college.

82
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:05,207
Little Suzie is growing up.

83
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,248
As soon as we nail Mendoza
my old lady and I...

84
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:10,807
are gonna sail around the world
like we always wanted.

85
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:13,251
We just christened a boat.

86
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:16,415
Yes, sir, everything
is gonna be just perf--

87
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:20,526
Aaah!

88
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,465
Damn, damn, damn. McBain.

89
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,008
- Yes?
- I'm not gonna make it.

90
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,044
Oh, stop talking crazy.

91
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:39,341
Just do one thing for me.

92
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:42,177
Get... Mendoza.

93
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:52,017
<i>Mendoza!</i>

94
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,993
- You want to rent it, sir?
- Why?

95
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,427
I just saw the best part.

96
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:59,096
Ooh.

97
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,193

101
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:14,375
Just grab something.
All these movies are great.

102
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:20,747
Look at this. ''Test your F.Q.--
Fatherhood Quotient.''

103
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:24,018
Maybe you should try it on Homer.
He'll fail it.

104
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,922
Uh-huh. In a second.

105
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,620
Well, I don't know.

106
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:31,062
Oh, now Henry Winkler,
there's a father.

107
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,396
Listen to what he told
a close friend.

108
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:36,027
''I don't always keep my cool
like the Fonz...

109
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:40,802
but my love for my kids has given me
plenty of happy days.''

110
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,899
Mmm.

111
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:45,104
<i>They call him
the Galloping Gazelle.</i>

<i>For six seasons and two Pro Bowls

114
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,654

in November...</i>

115
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:58,055

00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,561
Don't mind that clod, Patty.

119
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,865
You could turn the world on
with your smile.

120
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:12,428
Could you turn off the TV?

121
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:14,872
<i>- There's a test I want you to take.</i>

122
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:18,275
<i>- Oh, great.
You made me miss Joe Theisman.</i>

123
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:21,509
This is from the
National Fatherhood Institute.

124
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:24,813
It evaluates your knowledge
of your son and rates you as a father.

125
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:26,113
Oh, Marge.

126
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:29,452
Question one.
''Name one of your child's friends.''

127
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,889
Uh, let's see, Bart's friends.

128
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,792
Well, there's the fat kid
with the thing.

129
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:37,194
The little wiener who's always
got his hands in his pockets.

130
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,597
They want a name,
not a vague description.

131
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,430
Okay. Hank?

132
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,799
Hank? Hank who?

133
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,737
- Hank...Jones.
- Homer, you made that up.

134
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:49,139
Question two.
''Who is your son's hero?''

135
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,610
- Steve McQueen.
- That's your hero.

136
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,239
''Name another dad you talk to
about parenting.''

137
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:56,476
- Next.
- ''What are your son's hobbies?''

138
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,484
He's always chewing
on that phone cord.

139
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:01,350
- He hasn't done that since he was two.
- Then he has no hobbies.

140
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:04,858
Oh, really? Maybe you should go out
to the garage and see.

141
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:09,320
<i>Bart. Bart!</i>

142
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,262
- What?
- Do you have any hobbies?

143
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:13,527
- No, not really.
- Well, that's what I--

144
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,535
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

145
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:19,130
- Building a soap box derby racer.
- D'oh! That's a hobby.

146
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,673
Hey, so it is.

147
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:24,040
Oh, my God.
I don't know jack about my boy.

148
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:27,478
I'm a bad father.

149
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,175
You're also fat.

150
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,184
I'm also fat!

151
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,836

Please hold.

152
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:51,147
National Fatherhood Institute.

153
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,417
- Dave speaking.
- I'm Homer Simpson.
I just took your test.

154
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,582
I got a zero.

155
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:58,422
Good Lord! A zero?
Lana, cancel my 1 :00.

156
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:01,827
Mr. Simpson, we'll send a wood-paneled
station wagon over for you immediately.

157
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:04,492
Hey, Bart, where did
you get the lumber?

158
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:07,365
As three-time derby champ
Ronnie Beck says...

159
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:10,337
''Poorly guarded construction sites
are a gold mine.''

160
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,839
A conventional design.

161
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:14,376
<i>Yeah? Are you building
a racer, Martin?</i>

162
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:15,876
In between other projects.

163
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:19,676
If you'll excuse me, I've booked
some time at the wind tunnel.

164
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:26,149
Good-bye, son.

165
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:29,385
Bart, I think they're finally
hauling your dad away.

166
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,948
Maybe it's for the best.

167
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,859
For starters, Mr. Simpson...

168
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:45,203
<i>take this copy of Fatherhood
by Bill Cosby.</i>

169
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,437
If he's as smart
as he is funny, I'm sold.

170
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:52,675
If you want to be a good father,
you have to spend time with your son.

171
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:54,682
That's easy for you to say...

172
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,378
you preachy,
egg-headed institute guy.

173
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:00,616
<i>- How much do you see your son?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?</i>

174
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,090
- Homer, meet Dave,Jr.
- Huh?

175
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,558
How's your research, son?

176
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:06,959
I think we're near a breakthrough.

177
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:08,326
- Good work.
- Thanks, Dad.

178
00:10:08,397 --> 00:10:09,762
Oh, how I envy you.

179
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:13,165
That back and forther you witnessed
didn't happen overnight.

180
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:14,635
It took years of effort.

181
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:18,470
- I've never been afraid of hard work.
- That's the spirit.

182
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,875
Step one-- find an activity to share.
Does the boy have any interests?

183
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:24,378
- What boy?
- Your son.

184
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,881
Find something he likes
and share in it.

185
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:30,043
Well, he is building
a soap box derby racer!

186
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:32,553
Oh, that would be perfect.

187
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:35,318
Dear God! Not again!

188
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,986
Bart, I'm gonna help you
build that racer.

189
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,722
Thanks, but I'm almost done.

190
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,822
- Get back on the couch and watch TV.
- Okay.

191
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,662
No! I'm gonna do it.

192
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:48,670
Sorry, Dad, but three-time soap box
derby champion Ronnie Beck...

193
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:50,501
never needed his dad's help.

194
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:52,200
But you can use me.
I'm good.

195
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:55,369
I built a lot of things
around the house-- the spice rack...

196
00:10:57,913 --> 00:10:58,971
the bird feeder...

197
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:01,740
the Gymboree.

198
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:08,387
What was that? Ah, who cares?
Son, please let me help you.

199
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:10,448
Come on, Dad.
It would be weird.

200
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,222
This isn't working at all.
It's hopeless.

201
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:15,764
Wait a second.

202
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:17,162
Hmm.

203
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:21,761
''Cosby's first law
of intergenerational perversity.

204
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:24,397
''No matter what you tell
your child to do...

205
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:27,636
he will always
do the opposite.'' Huh?

206
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,304
<i>Don't you get it?
You gotta use reverse psychology.</i>

207
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,074
That sounds too complicated.

208
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:35,549
<i>- Okay, don't use reverse psychology.
- All right, I will.</i>

209
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:38,485
Son, I don't think
you should let me help you.

210
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:41,546
If you really want to help,
clean these paint brushes.

211
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:44,923
Thank you, Bill Cosby.
You've saved the Simpsons.

212
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:16,158
You know, Marge,
that Bart is a little miracle--

213
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:19,991
his winning smile, his button nose,
his fat little stomach...

214
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:22,895
his face alight
with wholesome mischief.

215
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:26,924
He reminds me of me before the weight
of the world crushed my spirit.

216
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,026
Hmm, yeah.

217
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:39,008
- I like our chances, son.
- Ugh!

218
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:41,072
Your father's not supposed
to help build your racer...

219
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,345
- but you should at least
consult him about it.
- D'oh!

220
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:45,751
You're in heat four.
Whoa. Where's your helmet?

221
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:47,254
Helmets are for wusses.

222
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,791
I can't let you go
without a helmet.

223
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:53,659
He's my son, and if he doesn't
wanna wear one, you can't make him.

224
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:57,597
Okay, fine. I wanna get out
of here sometime today.

225
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,963
Attention, everyone.

226
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:02,333
To those questioning the value
of the space program...

227
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:03,394
behold!

228
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:07,939
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

229
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,375
Hey...

230
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,276
you can't smoke in the pit area.

231
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:12,439
Fine.

232
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:15,177
Hey, Simpson...

233
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:16,843
where's your losermobile?

234
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,854
Losermobile. Wait a minute.

235
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:22,254
Uh, it's over there, Nelson.

236
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:25,521
Whoa, talk about
your pieces of crap.

237
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:29,325
I don't care who wins,
as long as one of us beats that guy.

238
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:31,628
- Same here.
- Careful, boys.

239
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,691
It took me months
to steal that bumper.

240
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,293
<i>Help! Help!</i>

241
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:37,134
- What was that?
- You didn't hear nothing!

242
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:40,572
- You nervous, son?
- Don't worry, Dad.

243
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:43,077
As three-time soap box derby
champion Ronnie Beck says...

244
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,238
''Gravity is my copilot.''

245
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:48,112
Hey, boss.
Just in case you need it.

246
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:51,051
Ahh, thanks, guys.

247
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,551
Now get out of here!

248
00:13:53,622 --> 00:13:57,285
Oh, I didn't realize
this hill was so high.

249
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,020
Could I have another--

250
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:25,279
Deploy, damn you! Deploy!

251
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,960
It hurts! It hurts!

252
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,555
Owee! Owee! Owee! Ow!

253
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:38,827
Mm-hmm.

254
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:40,835
Young man, this stress fracture...

255
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:43,963
will require you to be
in a cast for six weeks.

256
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,234
That means I can't possibly race.

257
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:47,639
You're lucky to be alive.

258
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,407
Save your palliative cliches
for the next poor sap, Doctor.

259
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,038
Is it okay to visit?

260
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:54,639
Of course.

261
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:56,480
Hey, man, cool crash.

262
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:58,918
- Way to cheat death.
- Thanks, Bart.

263
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:00,922
You had the best stick there.

264
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,924
I wish I could build 'em like you.

265
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:06,155
That racer transformed me
into the twisted creature...

266
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:07,855
you see before you.

267
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,989
I'll never race again.

268
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,090
If you don't race,
Nelson will win.

269
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,330
Even if I wanted to,
I'm in no shape to do it.

270
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:19,841
Unless--
Bart, will you drive my car?

271
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,638
I don't know if I should.

272
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,610
My dad and I built
our car together.

273
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,546
If I drove someone else's,
it'd kill him.

274
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:28,606
On the other hand, I'll do it.

275
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:31,619
We've got a lot of work
to do on the car.

276
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:33,985
I'm pulling you out of school
for two weeks--

277
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:38,083
I don't know how to say this,
but I don't wanna drive your car.

278
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,823
It's slow, it's ugly,
it handles like a shopping cart.

279
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:45,856
The car has a few bugs,
but we're Team Simpson.

280
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:49,371
Dad, I love you,
but you taught me to win.

281
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:51,998
- When did I teach you that?
- I picked it up somewhere.

282
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,167
If I drive Martin's car,
I can win.

283
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:57,371
- I'm sorry, but--
- No, go ahead, leave me.

284
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:01,280
- Dad--
- Go on and win.
Go on and win without your dad.

285
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,411
<i>I'll just sit here in Li'l Lightnin'
which the Simpsons built...</i>

286
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:08,422
and remember that for
one brief shining moment...

287
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,424
I had a son.

288
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,342
Ow.

289
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,141
Ohh!

290
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,546
Dad. Can you take me
to Dr. Hibbert's?

291
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,776
Why? What's wrong?

292
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,319
I scheduled a tetanus booster.

293
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:31,287
Maybe I'm being a little anal
but barefoot season's coming up...

294
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,551
and there's a world
of rusty nails out there.

295
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,458
Sure, I'll take you, wait with you,
worry about you...

296
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,156
then you'll ride home with someone
who has a faster car.

297
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,792
This is how you get your kicks,
isn't it, Lisa?

298
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:45,895
D'oh!

299
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,499
Martin, your bone is healing nicely.

300
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,338
Tell me something I don't know.

301
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,713
Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a--

302
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,715
You! Home wrecker!

303
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,776
Mr. Simpson, you have
every right to be angry.

304
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,151
But rest assured,
your son loves you.

305
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,893
You certainly gave that boy
the heebie-jeebies.

306
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,497
- Dad, aren't you coming?
- No.

307
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,971
- Now, don't pout.
- I'm not pouting. You are.

308
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,237
You gotta come. I just got
your hat out of the fridge.

309
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,302
- Sorry.
- Don't you have something
to say to Bart?

310
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,848
[ Homer]
No. Can't think of a thing.

311
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,079
I've always said
you were a good father.

312
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:36,950
I've always defended you
when people put you down.

313
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,286
- That's for sure.
- She ain't lying.

314
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:43,020
But I guess I was wrong.
You are a bad father.

315
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:44,220
Leave me alone.

316
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,362
Good morning, everybody...

317
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,564
and welcome to an event
that harkens back...

318
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,971
to the carefree days
of the Great Depression--

319
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,532
the soap box derby.

320
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,602
In just minutes these
junior Al Unser,Jrs...

321
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,705
will lock horns.

322
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:08,210
Huh? ''Name your son's hobbies.''

323
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,618
Building a soap box racer.

324
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,680
''Name one of your child's friends.''

325
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,520
Martin. Martin!

326
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,289
I'll curse that name
till the day I die!

327
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,954
Huh?

328
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,191
''Who is your son's hero?''

329
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,531
Three-time soap box derby
champion, Ronnie Beck.

330
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,868
Wow. I'm one question away
from being a perfect father.

331
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,874
''Name another dad
you talk to about parenting.''

332
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,001
- Ohh!
- Hey-hey-ho, Simpson.

333
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,205
Shut up, Flanders.
Flanders!

334
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,647
Flanders! Flanders. Uh-- Uh--

335
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,844
When should a boy start dating?

336
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,820
- There are two schools
of thought on the subject--
- Great! Thanks!

337
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,914
I talked to Flanders
about parenting!

338
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,925
I'm a perfect father!

339
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,393
Hold on, son.
I'm a-comin'.

340
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,791
My friend and I have a bet.

341
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,768
Are you Mary Tyler Moore?

342
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,638
Ooh! Wow! It really is you.

343
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:07,542
If she breaks up on you,
steer away from the grandstands...

344
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:10,479
or you might kill hundreds
of innocent spectators.

345
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:13,779
- What did I just tell you?
- Kill spectators.

346
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,343
What is the matter with you?

347
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,015
It's my dad--
lying there on the couch...

348
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,388
drinking a beer,
staring at the TV.

349
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,393
I've never seen him like that.

350
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:26,396
Forget about your father!
You're driving for me now.

351
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:34,637
Do it for your old man, boy.

352
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,933
Simpson, prepare to die.

353
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,135
Let's rock.

354
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,541
Ladies and gentlemen...

355
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,547
to drop the green flag--
our beloved mayor...

356
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,515
Diamond Joe Quimby.

357
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,610
To everyone participating today,
I salute your vigor.

358
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,088
Check out the rack on the blond
in the fourth row.

359
00:19:57,495 --> 00:20:00,362
Go! Go! Go! Go!

360
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,432
Ha! Ha!

361
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,162
<i>Like the elegant
Roman in Judah Ben-Hur...</i>

362
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,431
these modern charioteers
battle ferociously.

363
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:09,769
No quarter given;
none asked.

364
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,058
The world has not seen
the likes of this...

365
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,895
since the French carried
Lucky Lindy off on their shoulders...

366
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,366
from Le Bourget Field.

367
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:38,993
And now, to present the trophy...

368
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,301
three-time soap box derby champion,
Ronnie Beck.

369
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,206
Congratulations, Bart.

370
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:50,213
Seeing you out there
brought back a lot of memories.

371
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:51,543
Thanks, Mr. Beck.

372
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,208
I was alone out there...

373
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,878
but someone was riding
with me in spirit.

374
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,717
<i>This is for you, Dad.</i>

375
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,381
No, son, you earned it.

376
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:02,893
<i>I might remind you both
I did design that racer.</i>

377
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,020
The driver is essentially ballast.

378
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:10,567
The better man won, Simpson.
You can really drive.

379
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,569
Thanks, Nelson.
Put her there.

380
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,161
# Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha #

381
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,365
Loser!

382
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,771
# Na-na, na-na-na #

383
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,742
You know, there is such a thing
as being a bad winner.

384
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,939
Mom, I never won before.
I may never win again.

385
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,311
# Na-na, na-na-na #

386
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,782
That's my boy.
# Na-na, na-na-na #

387
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:28,978
# Na-na, na-na-na #

388
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:48,800
Shh!
