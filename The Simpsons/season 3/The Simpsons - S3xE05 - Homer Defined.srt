00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,490
<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:38,995
D'oh!

3
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,149
Here's good news.

4
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,817
According to this article...

5
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,488
S.A.T. scores are declining
at a slower rate.

6
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,225
I think this paper
is a flimsy hodgepodge...

7
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,767
of pie graphs, factoids
and Larry King.

8
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,962
This is the only paper
in America...

9
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,005
not afraid to tell the truth--

10
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,041
that everything is just fine.

11
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,167
''To me bestest bud Milhouse.

12
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,972
Happy birthday, Bart.''

13
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,910
Bart, that's so sweet.

14
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,812
May I see the card?

15
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,678
''I couldn't afford
to get you a new drum--''

16
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,149
Eww.

17
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,213
<i>Come on.</i>

18
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,452
Open it! Open it!

19
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,619
Uh... maybe
a little later, Bart.

20
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,153
Just 'cause your mom didn't
let you have a party--

21
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,996
We had a lovely time
on Saturday, Milhouse.

22
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,558
I liked the balloons.

23
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,298
I liked the party hats.

24
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:45,464
What do you mean?

25
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,733
Nothing.

26
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,404
Twins.

27
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,842
Open your present.

28
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,807
They're Krusty the Klown
walkie-talkies!

29
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,713
I'll keep one
and you keep one.

30
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,649
Whenever you want
to talk to me...

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,152
call me on the phone...

32
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,485
and tell me to turn on
my walkie-talkie.

33
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,491
I'd like to express my
appreciation for Saturday--

34
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,824
jellybean baskets,
personalized noisemakers--

35
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,593
but the little touches
are what made it enduring.

36
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,294
What's he talking about?

37
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,892
Hey, look at that dog.

38
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,437
Isn't that something?

39
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,497
Wow! Brown.

40
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,441
Whoa! Springfield Elementary,
last stop.

41
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,342
And by the way,
I'd like to say...

42
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,007
applause, applause
to birthday boy Milhouse...

43
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,947
for his totally bitchin' party...

44
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,450
on Saturday!

45
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,619
Milhouse, I think I left
my pants on your roof.

46
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,022
<i>You did have a party.</i>

47
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,491
You didn't invite me.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,653
And I thought
we were best friends.

49
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,321
Sorry, Bart.

50
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,361
Bye, little dudes.

51
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,334
Don't learn anything...

52
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,336
<i>I wouldn't learn.</i>

53
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,598
Ah, Monday morning.

54
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,934
Time to pay...

55
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,168
for your two days
of debauchery...

56
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,504
you hung-over drones.

57
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,839
T.G.I.M., sir.

58
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,176
What did you do
this weekend, Smithers?

59
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,112
I caught up
on my laundry...

60
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,117
wrote a letter
to my mother.

61
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,449
I took Hercules out
to be clipped.

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,181
Who the devil is Hercules?

63
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,517
My Yorkshire terrier.

64
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,614
He's tiny.

65
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,124
You know, it's a joke.

66
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,093
Here's a picture of Hurky.

67
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,458
Wheww.

68
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,657
Well, don't you know how
to paint the town red.

69
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,496
May I ask about your weekend?

70
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,298
A bit overly familiar,
but I'll allow it.

71
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,803
I took in a movie.

72
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,636
A piece of filth
featuring a blonde harlot...

73
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,643
who spent half the film
naked as a jaybird.

74
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,144
Give the great unwashed...

75
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,148
a pair of oversized breasts
and a happy ending...

76
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,877
and they'll oink
for more.

77
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,179
What a movie!

78
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,516
And that blonde--
does she have assets!

79
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,647
Heh-heh-heh!

80
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,850
Sounds like my kind of flick.

81
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:45,687
And how!

82
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,161
Eww! Lemon.

83
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,757
Ugh! Cherry.

84
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,199
Ooh... custard.

85
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,601
Mmm... purple!

86
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:12,950
Otto, welcome.

87
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,282
Apu, hey.

88
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,017
Got a bad case
of the munchies, man.

89
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,922
Time for a heat-lamp dog.

90
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,689
Did you know there's
a child in your bus?

91
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,286
<i>Good thing you warned me.</i>

92
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,093
I was heading to Mexico.

93
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,068
Call me old-fashioned,
but movies were sexier...

94
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,371
when the actors kept
their clothes on.

95
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,139
Vilma Banky did more
with one raised eyebrow...

96
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,373
than an entire--

97
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,642
Warning.
Problem in sector 7-G.

98
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,276
Good God! Who's
the safety inspector there?

99
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:48,287
Uh, Homer Simpson, sir.

100
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,652
Simpson, eh?

101
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,054
Good man? Intelligent?

102
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,855
Actually, he was hired
under ''Project Bootstrap.''

103
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,954
Thank you, President Ford.

104
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,534
Huh?

105
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,932
Noise.

106
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,299
Bad noise.

107
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,133
Five minutes
before critical mass.

108
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:07,470
Critical wha-- ?

109
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,738
Whosever problem this is,
I'm sure they can handle it.

110
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,841
Huh?

111
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:15,939
It's my problem!

112
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,313
We're doomed!

113
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,547
Sector 7-G
is now being isolated.

114
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,351
My best friend shafted me.

115
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,358
I'll never get over this,
Otto-man.

116
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,859
Sure, you will.

117
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,293
My old lady ran off
and married my brother.

118
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:34,300
It hurt, but it's a month later,
and I'm sleeping on their couch.

119
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,630
Marguerita...

120
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,295
I want you.

121
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:41,034
Mr. Devereaux, I can't work
under these conditions.

122
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,508
Have it your way, baby.

123
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,976
You're fired.

124
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,980
Oh, Avery.

125
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,982
Call me Mr. Devereaux.

126
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,019
<i>We interrupt
Search for the Sun for this bulletin.</i>

127
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,349
Forget the hair.
Just give me the blush.

128
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,756
Oh, we're on.

129
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,728
This station has learned
that a crisis is in progress...

130
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,923
at the
Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.

131
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,261
Oh, my Lord!

132
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,268
On the line is plant owner
C. Montgomery Burns.

133
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,894
Oh, hello, Kent.

134
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,939
Right now, skilled technicians...

135
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:16,499
are calmly correcting a minor,
piffling malfunction...

136
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,945
<i>...but I can assure you
and the public...</i>

137
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:23,210
<i>that there's absolutely...</i>

138
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:24,774
<i>no danger whatsoever.</i>

139
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,082
<i>Things couldn't be
more shipshape.</i>

140
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,781
<i>Where's my radiation suit?</i>

141
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,324
How the hell should I know?

142
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:34,122
People are calling this a meltdown.

143
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,958
That's one of
those annoying buzz words.

144
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:40,296
We prefer to call it an
''unrequested fission surplus.''

145
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,234
Homie, please, be all right.

146
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:44,236
Got to think!

147
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:45,829
Somewhere there's a thingy...

148
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,136
that tells you
how to work this stuff.

149
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,470
The, um... manual!

150
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,976
The manual, right.

151
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:51,909
Aha!

152
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,240
It's as fat as a phone book!

153
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:58,012
''Congratulations
on your purchase...

154
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,577
of a Fissionator
1 952 slow fission reactor--''

155
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,919
D'oh! Get to the point.

156
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,618
Ooh, what's this?

157
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,253
D'oh! Who'd have thought
a nuclear reactor...

158
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,819
would be so complicated?

159
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,558
90 seconds to core meltdown.

160
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,897
There may never be another time
to say... I love you, sir.

161
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,095
Oh, hot dog.

162
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,604
Thank you for making
my last few moments...

163
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,866
socially awkward.

164
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,670
Looks like this is the end.

165
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:23,937
That's all right.

166
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,979
I couldn't have led
a richer life.

167
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,412
After the meltdown,
expect roving bands--

168
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,949
I don't like this program.

169
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,416
Change the channel.

170
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,952
...traffic for hours.

171
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>Wheel of Fortune!</i>

172
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,953
I don't understand anything.

173
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,960
When they look up ''stupid''
in a dictionary...

174
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,962
there will be a picture of me.

175
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,438
Dear Lord,
if you spare this town...

176
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,567
from becoming a smoking hole
in the ground...

177
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,907
I'll try
to be a better Christian.

178
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,243
I don't know what I can do.

179
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,910
Um... oh, the next time
there's a canned food drive...

180
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,579
I'll give the poor something
they'd actually like...

181
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,214
instead of old lima beans
and pumpkin mix.

182
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,882
One minute to core meltdown.

183
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,926
Shut up!

184
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,927
Simpson, it's all up to you.

185
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,519
It's show time!

186
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,593
Okay, okay,
think back to your training.

187
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,602
This may well save your life one day.

188
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,932
- Homer?
- Yeah?

189
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,099
This button controls
the emergency override.

190
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,804
In a meltdown, push this button,
and only this button.

191
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,937
Ooh, a side.

192
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,275
- Simpson!
- What?

193
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,781
You see which button?

194
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,942
Yeah, yeah, push the button.
Got it.

195
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,181
<i>This is all your fault!</i>

196
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,779
Got to pick a button.

197
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,120
One potato, two potato--
No, wait.

198
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,285
Bubble gum, bubble gum,
in a dish.

199
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,124
How many pieces do you wish?

200
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,288
No! No!

201
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,127
30 seconds to core meltdown.

202
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,894
I guess there's nothing left...

203
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,197
but to kiss my sorry ass
good-bye.

204
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,862
May I, sir?

205
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:58,870
Ughh.

206
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,270
These unfortunate people...

207
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,739
will be instantly killed.

208
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,334
This circle, which I am
sad to say we are in...

209
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,744
will experience a slower,
considerably more painful death.

210
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,442
Good Lord!

211
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:13,452
They called me old-fashioned
for teaching ''duck and cover''...

212
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,782
but who's laughing now?

213
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,982
1 5 seconds to core meltdown.

214
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,786
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

215
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,793
Catch a tiger by the toe.

216
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,795
If he hollers, let him go.

217
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,127
Eeny, meeny, miney...

218
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,050
...moe.

219
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,421
All systems returning to normal.

220
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,357
Danger in 7-G neutralized.

221
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:38,587
Have a nice day.

222
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,596
Whew.

223
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,205
Will I ever
see you again?

224
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:55,209
Sure, baby.

225
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:56,472
Next meltdown. Heh.

226
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,146
I'd like to solve the puzzle.

227
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:06,052
''Three loins in the fountain.''

228
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,285
We've isolated the problem.

229
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,022
Wouldn't you know-- false alarm.

230
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:15,530
It seems a single wayward crow...

231
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,396
flew into our warning system.

232
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,560
Your point
about nuclear hysteria...

233
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:20,568
is well taken.

234
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,070
This reporter promises...

235
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,265
to be less vigilant
in the future.

236
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:25,433
Excellent.

237
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,806
Well, ta.

238
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,744
Smithers, I can still
sell them snake oil.

239
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,747
Now, bring me
a wine spritzer...

240
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,340
<i>and don't be stingy
with the vino.</i>

241
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,748
Yes, sir.

242
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:37,047
So, Smithers...

243
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,180
it seems you've underestimated
one Homer Simpson...

244
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:43,556
our next
employee of the month.

245
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:48,287
Milhouse, a little salt?

246
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:49,559
Sure.

247
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,299
Ohh!

248
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:52,300
Ha-ha-ha.

249
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,360
Now we're even
for your party.

250
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:55,904
Come on,
let's go play.

251
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:58,998
My mom won't let me
be your friend anymore.

252
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,702
That's why you
couldn't come.

253
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,438
What's she got against me?

254
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:04,446
She says you're a bad influence.

255
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:06,106
Bad influence, my butt!

256
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,514
Never listen
to your mother.

257
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,110
She threatened
to cut off my allowance.

258
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:12,779
Whatever
she's paying you...

259
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,050
I'll double it.

260
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:15,182
I'm really sorry.

261
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,727
Sir, if you'll recall...

262
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:21,992
I'm the one who put
a five-percent ceiling...

263
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:23,396
on the Keogh plan--

264
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,696
You bean counter,
give it up.

265
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,168
Simpson's my man.

266
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,234
Hey, way to save
our lives.

267
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,740
Yeah,
we owe you one.

268
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:33,173
Well, you know, boys...

269
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:35,973
a nuclear reactor
is a lot like a woman--

270
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:39,743
you just read the manual
and press the right button.

271
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:42,984
Simpson?

272
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:43,815
Monty Burns.

273
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,115
Come with me.

274
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,520
Homer! Homer! Homer!

275
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,116
Now, now... that will do.

276
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:53,685
Homer, for your bravery
and skill...

277
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:54,957
we award you...

278
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:57,693
this ham,
this plaque...

279
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,201
this discount coupon book...

280
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,534
and my own personal thumbs-up.

281
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,299
Ahh!

282
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,308
Hah!

283
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,572
And to ensure your immortality...

284
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,807
your heroic visage
will be added...

285
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:13,815
to our wall of fame.

286
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:15,373
Oh, and what's this?

287
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:19,718
A congratulatory phone call
from Earvin ''Magic''Johnson?

288
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,283
MagicJohnson?!

289
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,451
Yello.

290
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,118
Is this Homer Simpson?

291
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,355
Yeah.

292
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,727
Homer, I just used
our last time-out...

293
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,766
to call and congratulate you...

294
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,734
on averting nuclear holocaust.

295
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:33,962
Well, thank you.

296
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:36,835
If you play on that ankle,
you'll be in pain.

297
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:37,998
I don't care.

298
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:40,975
Magic, what if people think
a guy's a hero...

299
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:42,841
but he was just lucky?

300
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:47,008
Sooner or later people like that
are exposed as frauds.

301
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,574
Thanks, Magic.

302
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:57,550
Oh!

303
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,895
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

304
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:04,899
Aah!

305
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:08,263
Hee-hee-hee-hee!

306
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,875
Bart,
you're not laughing.

307
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:19,005
Too subtle?

308
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:20,709
No, I'm just depressed.

309
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:24,550
Milhouse's mom won't let me
play with him anymore.

310
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:31,617
Homer, did you go out
and buy a 20-pound ham?

311
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:32,855
What's all this?

312
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:33,691
D'oh!

313
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:35,390
''For heroic competence.

314
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,729
For narrowly
averting a meltdown...

315
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:39,769
and proving without question...

316
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:42,999
that nuclear power
is completely safe.

317
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,938
Employee of the month!''

318
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,999
Oh, Homer!

319
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,009
Ohh.

320
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,014
A role model
in my very own home.

321
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,519
How convenient.

322
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,023
Look, I get enough admiration
and respect at work.

323
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,685
I don't need it
here at home.

324
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,024
How are you enjoying
your ham?

325
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,587
Tastes so bitter,
it's like ashes.

326
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:11,532
It's actually more
of a honey glaze.

327
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,829
Maybe you ate a clove.

328
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:14,870
<i>What's your problem, boy?</i>

329
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,701
I had a fight
with Milhouse.

330
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,765
You don't need friends
like that four-eyes.

331
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,003
How Zen.

332
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,545
What?

333
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,546
What is it?

334
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,946
What you doing?

335
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,779
Looking at you with quiet awe.

336
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,251
As long as it's quiet.

337
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,496
Milhouse to Bart.

338
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:42,826
Milhouse to Bart.

339
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,662
Please don't hate me.

340
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,793
Please?

341
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,240
Ooh, right next to the boss.

342
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:02,409
Aw, he'll never know who did it.

343
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,856
Ah, Simpson,
there's someone...

344
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:14,487
I want you to meet--
Aristotle Amadopolis...

345
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:17,464
owner of Shelbyville's
nuclear power facility.

346
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:20,797
Huh? What?

347
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,532
Ari's been having
terrible worker problems.

348
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,335
They've lost
their zest for work.

349
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,773
<i>Help them find their
eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve.</i>

350
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,743
<i>Their eanae-haratou-doola what?</i>

351
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,939
We want you to give them
a pep talk...

352
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,744
that turns them
from donut-eating goof-offs...

353
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,148
into Homer Simpsons.

354
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:38,083
I can't tell them
anything.

355
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:40,553
Cut the false modesty!
It's tiresome.

356
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,525
Besides, employee of the month
isn't all ham and plaques.

357
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:48,190
Well, Smithers.

358
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:50,528
How kind of you
to pay us a visit.

359
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,827
Couldn't help it, sir.

360
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,266
Parking here is terrible.

361
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,434
This man has no love...

362
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:56,732
for his power plant.

363
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:58,204
Begone from my sight.

364
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,537
That one's
always been a problem.

365
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:04,841
One, two, three.

366
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,508
''Community Chest.''

367
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,607
Nah.

368
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:09,616
Nah.

369
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:10,845
Ah!

370
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,252
I've won second prize
in a beauty contest.

371
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,254
Collect ten bucks.

372
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,450
Ha, ha!
You're losing.

373
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,828
Bart, don't feed
your sister...

374
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,021
hotels.

375
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,087
Don't worry.
There's tons.

376
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:25,326
That game
is too old for her.

377
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,925
Go play with Milhouse.

378
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,435
I don't want to.

379
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,165
You haven't made up?

380
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,366
His mom says
I'm a bad influence.

381
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:35,308
Let's go throw rocks
at that hornets' nest.

382
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:42,278
Mrs. Van Houten,
I'm Bart's mother.

383
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,911
We met when
the boys drank paint.

384
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,682
I remember.
Please come in.

385
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,779
Marge, I'm sorry...

386
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:49,756
but I think
it would be better...

387
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,918
if Milhouse
didn't see your son.

388
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,963
Look, I know Bart
can be a handful...

389
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,329
but I also know
what he's like inside.

390
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,867
He's got a spark.

391
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,493
It's not a bad thing.

392
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,834
Of course,
it makes him do bad things.

393
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,567
Well, Marge, the other day...

394
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:07,905
Milhouse told me
my meat loaf sucks.

395
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:10,844
He must have gotten that
from your little boy...

396
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:14,076
because they certainly
don't say that word on TV.

397
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,016
Well, I can't defend
everything he does...

398
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,280
but let's face it.

399
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:21,118
All Bart and Milhouse have
is each other.

400
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,953
They're too young
for girls...

401
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,619
and they're a popular target
for bullies...

402
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:28,891
and in the Christmas pageant,
they're always sheep.

403
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,489
<i>Please, please,
let them be friends.</i>

404
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:39,201
I'll think about it.

405
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:42,906
So the next time
somebody tells you...

406
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,208
carny folk are good,
honest people...

407
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,544
you can spit
in their faces for me.

408
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:48,844
If you'll excuse me...

409
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,613
I'm profiling my dad
for the school paper.

410
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:54,383
I thought I'd follow him around
for a day...

411
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:56,287
to see what makes him tick.

412
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,450
Aw, that's sweet.

413
00:17:57,526 --> 00:17:59,756
I followed my dad
to a lot of bars too.

414
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,987
One beer, one chocolate milk.

415
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,397
Excuse me,
I have the chocolate milk.

416
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,491
Oh.

417
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,235
What's the matter,
Homer?

418
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:10,896
Alcohol's
depressing effects...

419
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,838
don't kick in
till closing.

420
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:14,239
He's a little nervous.

421
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,710
He has to give a speech
on keeping cool in a crisis.

422
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,247
What will I do?!
What will I do?!

423
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:20,576
I gave a speech once.

424
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:23,311
I was pretty nervous,
so I used a little trick.

425
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,479
I pictured everyone
in their underwear--

426
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:29,991
the judge, the jury, my lawyer--
everybody.

427
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,253
Did it work?

428
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:32,418
I'm a free man.

429
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:33,927
Milhouse to Bart.

430
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:35,930
Do you want
to come over and play?

431
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,262
Really?
We can be friends again?

432
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,925
Did your mom die?

433
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:41,526
Uh... I don't think so.

434
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:42,729
Well, who cares?

435
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,500
Milhouse, I'll be right there.

436
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:45,505
Sorry, Maggie.

437
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:47,337
Game's over.

438
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:48,637
Hey, Mom!

439
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,235
I'm friends
with Milhouse again.

440
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,406
I knew his mother
would come to her senses.

441
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,814
Thanks for sticking up
for me.

442
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,146
<i>Who says I did it?</i>

443
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,186
Who else would?

444
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:01,751
Aw...

445
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:02,950
you be good.

446
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,151
I will.

447
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,135
As I look into this sea
of smiling faces...

448
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:17,434
I am filled with a sense
of loathing and revulsion.

449
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:18,837
You are not workers.

450
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,374
You are a pack...

451
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,808
of mangy, cud-chewing,
ugly goats.

452
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:24,812
Well, you're in for a treat.

453
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,871
We have with us today
a real man.

454
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,645
Behold the glory
that is Homer Simpson.

455
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,613
Uh...

456
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:37,591
''ladies and...

457
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:38,853
gentlemen.''

458
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:45,099
Just picture them
in their underwear.

459
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,803
Whew!

460
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,669
Ahh!

461
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,302
''Grace under pressure... is no--''

462
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,938
Three minutes to meltdown.

463
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,818
Whew! Saved by the bell.

464
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,787
1 5 seconds to core meltdown.

465
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,789
Just do what
you did before.

466
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,154
All right.

467
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:14,855
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

468
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,296
Catch a tiger by toe.

469
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,697
If he hollers, let him go.

470
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,964
Eeny, meeny, miney... moe.

471
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:24,505
Crisis has been averted.

472
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:25,972
Everything is super.

473
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,772
Thank you, Homer,
for saving my plant...

474
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,643
with that idiotic rhyming!

475
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:35,376
Do you even know
what button you pushed?!

476
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,384
Sure-- moe.

477
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,352
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

478
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,013
Is Homer a hero?

479
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,784
The answer is no.

480
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:46,316
I'm Kent Brockman
and that was ''My Two Cents.''

481
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:48,727
Now, Scott Christian
with ''Laugh and a Half.''

482
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:49,786
Thanks, Kent.

483
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:52,060
There was more dumb luck today...

484
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:55,069
when Police Chief Wiggum
foiled a bank holdup...

485
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:56,399
without even trying.

486
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:59,599
It seems the chief
had gone to the bank...

487
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,472
to cash in his penny jar.

488
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,135
...48, 49, 50.

489
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:04,270
What the-- ?

490
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,335
Ooh!

491
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:06,472
Good work, Chief.

492
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:07,947
Just doing my job.

493
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:12,214
Yes, it seems the chief pulled
a Homer Simpson of his own.

494
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,181
Whoa!

495
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,987
Huh?

496
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,322
A pretzel?

497
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:23,590
Wow! Looks like
I pulled a Homer.

498
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:26,862
MagicJohnson coming down the floor.

499
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:28,766
His feet slip out
from under him!

500
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:31,670
The ball flies loose,
hits the referee...

501
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,298
goes in the basket!

502
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,569
It's a three-point play!

503
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:35,701
The Lakers win!

504
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,369
Looks like I pulled a Homer.

505
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,373
Our dad!

506
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:44,681
Now he belongs to the ages.

507
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,176
Shh!
