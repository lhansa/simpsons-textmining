D'oh!

3
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:30,373
Hey, what gives?

4
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:33,379
You said you wanted
a world without zinc,Jimmy.

5
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:35,574
Well, now your car
has no battery.

6
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,550
I'm supposed to pick Betty up.

7
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:40,212
I better give her a call.

8
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:45,889
Sorry,Jimmy.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,485
Without zinc
for the rotary mechanism

10
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:50,154
there are no telephones.

11
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,163
Dear God.

12
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:52,665
What have I done?

13
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:58,264
Think again,Jimmy.

14
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:00,671
The firing pin
in your gun was made of...

15
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:02,538
yup... zinc.

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,544
Come back, zinc.

17
00:01:04,612 --> 00:01:06,637
Come back.

18
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:08,409
Come back.

19
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,507
Zinc, come back.

20
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,516
Zinc!

21
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:12,847
Zinc, zinc!

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,046
What?

23
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:17,215
Oh, it was all a dream.

24
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,522
Thank goodness I still live
in a world of telephones

and many things

26
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:25,190

27
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,393
Gross! He's picking his nose.

28
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:29,898
Hmph!

29
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:34,040
If anyone wants to learn
more about zinc

30

I haven't seen you

37

since we doubled
our prices.

38
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:54,993
Still teaching?

39

Let's see.

40
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:00,023
One more day at least.

41
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:05,637

It might be fun.

49
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,191
Kind of a lark.

51
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,361

Ow, my eyeball!

54
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:44,370
Enough, people.

55
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:46,037

58
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:56,015
Knock it off!.

59

Ted Carpenter from

62
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,090
Kids, this is a yo-yo.

63
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,659
Kind of dull, huh?

64
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:12,297
Not much competition
for a video game...

65
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:14,136
<i>or is it?</i>

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,182

73
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,533
These guys must be millionaires.

74
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:45,197
I'll bet they get
all kinds of girls.

75
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,706
I question the value
of this assembly.

76
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:49,572
It will be
a pleasant memory

77
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,077
when they're pumping gas
for a living.

78
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:09,794
Now, for our next stunt,
what do you say

79
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:12,128
we get your principal
up here?

80
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,593
Ooh... careful now.

81
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,160
That one grazed my ear.

82
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,171
Don't move.

83
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,003
You could really get hurt.

84
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,099
Oh.

85
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:23,666
How much do those cost?

86
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:24,904
I don't care.

87
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,013
Wow!

88
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,572
Thanks, Sparkle.

89
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,582
Wait.

90
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:31,845
This isn't you.

91
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,682
That's the old Sparkle.

92
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:36,188
Get your worthless butts
in the van.

93
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:38,020
We got three more schools.

94
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:39,855

95
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:52,797
That's your trick?

96
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:55,808
No. Here's my trick.
Hoowah!

97
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:02,948
Whoa!
Whoa!

98
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:03,949
Thank you.

99
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:07,153
Marge, come here.

100
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,553
Can you believe it?

101
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,616
Soon, I'll be able
to quit my job

102
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:14,991
and live off the boy.

103
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,324
Name me one person

104
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:19,491

<i>''After two months at sea</i>

112
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,840
No, they did not have yo-yos.

113

00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:44,119
No, they did not have yo-yos!

117
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:45,852
I am sick and tired

118
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,518

119
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,529

any book reports

00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,307
got any new tricks
for us today?

126
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,603
Just one.

127
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:05,645
A little something I call
''Plucking the Pickle.''

128
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,578
I build up a little steam,
and...

129
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,381
I didn't do it.

130

Don't worry
about your wee fish, lass.

They're going to a better place.

132
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,619
That's one month's
detention.

133
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:25,824
Mrs. Krabappel, we're all upset

134
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,993
by the untimely deaths
of Stinky and Wrinkles

135
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,331
but life goes on.

136
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:32,964
So, if I could have
my yo-yo back...

137
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,166
If you were me

138
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:36,505
would you give back
the yo-yo?

139
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:39,102

141
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,171
Just kidding.

142
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,150
Well, would you?

143
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:46,208
Absolutely.

144
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,184
P-hih!

145
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,285
What's eating you,
woman?

146
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,296
Your ad said
you wanted a man.

147
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:59,559
You got yourself
a hummm-dinger.

148
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,294
I guess I expected

149
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:03,461
something different
from your photo.

150
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:06,665
Just because there's
a little snow on the roof...

151
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,935
I forget how the rest
of that goes.

152
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:11,838
One month's detention.

153
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:13,539
She'll pay for this.

154
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:15,809
Yup, there's your problem.

155
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:18,511
Someone jammed
a Malibu Stacy head down here.

156
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,520
Edna, happy hour
in the teachers' lounge.

157
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:23,749
Just a sec.

158
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:26,791
Hmm.

159
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:31,823
Huh?

160
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:34,265
''One plus one equals two?''

161
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:46,511
''Write Edna K. Box 402.''

162
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:50,778
Hmm.

163
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:53,285
<i>Dear Edna...</i>

164
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,618
<i>I never answered

<i>My name is...</i>

167
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:06,625
<i>... Woodrow.</i>

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,327
<i>I like holding hands</i>

169
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:10,962
<i>and dinner by candlelight</i>

170
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,474
<i>and oh,yes,
I really hate yo-yos.</i>

171
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,304
Oh, Woodrow!

172
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:23,801
Maybe we should
let the dog in.

173
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:26,308
Marge, dogs love the outdoors.

174
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,473
<i>I think he needs a doghouse.</i>

175
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:32,708
What can you do?

176
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:36,479
I bet we could buy
a nice doghouse for $50.

177
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:39,215
Marge, you're a tool
of the doghouse makers.

178
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,381
I am not.

179
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:41,890
Yes, you are.

180
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,619
You've been brainwashed

181
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:46,628
by all those doghouse
commercials on TV.

182
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:49,164
<i>I know. I'll build
him a doghouse.</i>

183
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:50,665
Oh, I don't know.

184
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:51,826
Don't worry.

185
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:53,802
I drew up a little blueprint.

186
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,667
Let me walk you through it.

187
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:57,172
This is a door.

188
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,901
He goes through that.

189
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,408
This is a roof.

190
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:03,002
And this happy character here
is the sun.

191
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,104
He shines down on the house.

192
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:06,910
How was detention today?

193
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,416
Oh, not bad.

194
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:13,354
I'm starting to get the hang
of the floor waxer.

195
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:14,685
Yes!

196
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:17,818
<i>''Dear Woodrow,you're not like</i>

197
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:19,691
<i>the other men I've met. ''</i>

198
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:22,561
I'm the 28th president
of the United States.

199
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:25,567
<i>''I've had some bad experiences
with these ads.</i>

200
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,934
<i>I'd like to learn more
about you, so write soon.</i>

201
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:32,338
<i>Here's a photo that will
get your pencil moving. ''</i>

202
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:35,435
You've got a date
with the Xerox machine.

203
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:38,780
Stupid lumber.

204
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:39,940
Damn it!

205
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:41,449
D'oh! I--

206
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,281
Oh, the hell
with this!

207
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:46,151
A fellow came in asking
for change for a dollar.

208
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:48,383
I gave him three quarters
by mistake.

209
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,790
Took me the whole afternoon
to find him.

210
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,192
Todd, would you like
mixed vegetables?

211
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:53,922
Hell no.

212
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:56,023
What did you say?

213
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:58,363
I don't want
any damn vegetables.

214
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:01,199
All right. No Bible stories
for you tonight.

215
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:05,637
Weren't you
a little hard on him?

216
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,643
Well, you knew
I had a temper

217
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,042
when you married me.

218
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:11,580
Ned Flanders
is on the phone.

219
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:15,641
Oh, if this is about
that stupid quarter again, I--

220
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,311
Hello, Ned.

221
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:19,753
Sorry to bother you,
Reverend Lovejoy.

222
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:21,688
Our son Todd just told us

223
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:24,386
he didn't want to eat
his damn vegetables.

224
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,326
You know kids and vegetables.

225
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:27,658
Was it asparagus?

226
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,164
No, no, Reverend.

227
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:31,325
The point is he said a bad word.

228
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:32,834
Oh. Oh, right.

229
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:36,269
Well, kids usually pick
these things up from someplace.

230
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,570
Find out who's doing it,
and direct them to the Bible.

231
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:40,905
Where in the Bible?

232
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:42,410
Uh... page 900.

233
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,912
But, Reverend...

234
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,278
Damn Flanders.

235
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:49,113
Hey, Lise,
a moment of your time.

236
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,447
Yeah?

237
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,182
Suppose I was writing
a second letter to a girl

238
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:55,622
and I already used up
my ''A'' material.

239
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:58,286
Ooh, could it be
there's a special someone

240
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,226
you're not
telling me about?

241
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:00,785
Is it Teri?

242
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:01,296
No.

243
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:01,762
Sheri?

244
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:02,320
No!

245
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,127
That girl

246
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,291
with the lazy eye?

247
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:05,197
No.

248
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,065
That exchange student Mix!pa?

249
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:08,729
No! It's not for me.

250
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,238
It's... homework.

251
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:11,739
Sure it is.

252
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:14,368
Hey, Bart,
let's do some homework.

253
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:21,075
<i>Golly, Sergeant Carter,
I can't fix yourjeep</i>

254
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:23,642
<i>but maybe this
will make it up to you.</i>

255
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,656
<i>[ Deep Baritone ]
## Galveston, oh, Galveston ##</i>

256
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,487
Is this all he watches?

257
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,823
<i>He used to watch
Davy and Goliath</i>

258
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:34,455
but he thought the idea
of a talking dog

259
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,294
was blasphemous.

260
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:38,698
Mom, did you save
Dad's love letters?

261
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,599
Of course I saved them.

262
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,763
Well, actually,
there's only one

263
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,136
and it's more

264
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:47,665
of a love postcard
from some brewery he visited.

265
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:49,974
<i>''Maybe it's the beer talking</i>

266
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,514
<i>but you've got a butt
that won't quit.</i>

267
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:55,278
<i>They got these big,
chewy pretzels here... ''</i>

268
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,352
<i>''...Five dollars?.!
Get outta here. ''</i>

269
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:02,186
Wow, a side of Dad
I've never seen!

270
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:05,291
Penny for your thoughts,
Miss K.

271
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:06,623
I was just thinking...

272
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:08,459
You wouldn't
be interested.

273
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,294
Try me.
It helps to talk.

274
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:14,296
Well, I was just wishing
I could meet a man

275
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,464
who likes the way I look
first thing in the morning.

276
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,474
- Laughs at my jokes.
- Uh-huh.

277
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,271
- Can fix my car.
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:26,543
<i>''Dear Edna,your photo
took my breath away.</i>

279
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:30,143
<i>Truly,yours is a butt
that won't quit.</i>

280
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,653
<i>Yesterday morning</i>

281
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:34,155
<i>I put your picture up
in my garage</i>

282
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:37,421
<i>to inspire me while I
gapped my spark plugs. ''</i>

283
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,656
At last,
we've built the mission.

284
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:44,495
Finally, the villagers
have a place to pray.

285
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:46,626
# Bringing in the sheaves #

286
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:48,762
# Bringing in the sheaves #

287
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:50,897
#We shall come rejoicing ##

288
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:54,740
Well, he's not getting it
from his brother

289
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:56,244
that's for darn sure.

290
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:58,143
<i>Damn crappy nails.!</i>

291
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:00,148
<i>Super glue, my butt.!</i>

292
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:02,616
D'oh! You bas..!

293
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,277
Hit it..! Shot..! D'oh!

294
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:05,286
Homer?

295
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:06,788
What is it, Flanders?

296
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:09,620
I'm afraid I have a bone
to pick with you.

297
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:12,593
If it's about your camcorder,
I lost it, okay?

298
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:16,291
No, I came to talk to you
about your... potty mouth.

299
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,492
What the hell

300
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:18,829
are you talking about?

301
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:21,598
All of us pull a few boners
now and then--

302
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:24,606
Go off half-cocked,
make asses of ourselves.

303
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:26,505
I don't want
to be hard on you

304
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:29,773
but I wish you wouldn't curse
in front of my boys.

305
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:32,178
Oh, come on now, Flanders.

306
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,842
I don't complain about your...

307
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,510
moustache.

308
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,747
What's wrong with my moustache?

309
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:41,916
Uh, it makes you look like
you got something to hide.

310
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:42,923
What?

311
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:44,254
People are talking.

312
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:45,589
Lots of people.

313
00:13:45,662 --> 00:13:46,959
Okay, mister

314
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,258
you've got a deal.

315
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:50,265
I'll shave off
the soup-strainer

316
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,097
if you give the sailor talk
the old heave-ho.

317
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,797
Aye, aye... Admiral Butthead.

318
00:13:55,872 --> 00:14:00,309
<i>We now return to Two for Tunisia
on Colorization Theater.</i>

319
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:01,604
Ah, my love.

320
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:04,943
A million poets could try
for a million years

321
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:08,950
and still describe but
three-eighths of your beauty.

322
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,043
Whoa, slow down, Frenchy.

323
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,678
<i>This stuff is gold.</i>

324
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:15,849
''A million poets working
for a million years...''

325
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:17,358
You're so lucky.

326
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,486
When are you
going to meet him?

327
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:21,860
First, I ask him
to send a photo.

328
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:24,525
If he's got everything
where it should be

329
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,125
I'm reeling him in.

330
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:31,463
Strap on your skates, Gordie.

331
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,975
You're going in.

332
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:36,068
<i>Hey, Marge, do you want to hear</i>

333
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:37,407
something funny?

334
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,744
Flanders thinks
I swear too much.

335
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:42,918
Marge, you're not laughing.

336
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:44,578
Well, maybe he's right.

337
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,246
Well, what a surprise.

338
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:48,119
Marge sticks up
for Flanders.

339
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,125
Can we have
a conversation

340
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:53,287
<i>where you don't bring up
your hero Ned Flanders?</i>

341
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:55,593
<i>Homer, you brought up
Ned Flanders.</i>

342
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:57,428
Maybe I do curse a little

343
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,197
but that's the way God made me,
and I'm too old to stop now.

344
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:02,704
No, you're not.

345
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:05,935
After the navy, my father
used to curse a blue streak.

346
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,035
It almost cost him his job
as a baby photographer

347
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:12,013
so my mom put a swear jar
in the kitchen.

348
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,379
Every time he said
a bad word

349
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,384
he put in a quarter.

350
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,215
Well, Marge

351
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:21,587
self-improvement has always
been a passion of mine.

352
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,387
Bring on the swear jar.

353
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,451
Do I have to pay if I
hit my hand with a hammer?

354
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,461
Yes, Homer.

355
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,622
If I catch fire?

356
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:29,630
No, Homer.

357
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,291
If I see something weird?

358
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:32,299
Yes, Homer.

359
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:33,960
What about when we snuggle?

360
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:35,834
Hmm...
That's okay.

361
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:39,204
<i>''Dear Woodrow,
it's time for us to meet.</i>

362
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:41,402
<i>Why don't we go out to dinner?</i>

363
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:45,072
<i>After, we'll go to my apartment
for some home cookin'. ''</i>

364
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:46,410
Huh?

365
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:47,949
<i>Ay, caramba.!</i>

366
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,575
<i>''Hungrily yours, Edna. ''</i>

367
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:50,949
Well, she's dangled

368
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,612
on the line long enough.

369
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,623
It's time to boat this bass.

370
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:58,388
<i>''When I read your letters,
I feel as if you are right here</i>

371
00:15:58,461 --> 00:15:59,792
<i>watching me. ''</i>

372
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:00,794
Bart! Eyes down.

373
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:01,989
Yes, ma'am.

374
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:04,090
<i>''Every second until we meet</i>

375
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,362
<i>stabs me
like a thousand needles.</i>

376
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:10,395
<i>Join me at the Gilded Truffle
Saturday at 8::00.</i>

377
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:13,374
<i>Perhaps later
we will smooch up a storm.</i>

378
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:15,274
<i>Sexily yours, Woody. ''</i>

379
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:33,961
Huh?

380
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:45,904
Oh, I can't help but feel
partly responsible.

381
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,566
Homer,
that was a 20.

382
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,576
Da..!

383
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,810
Oh, you son..!

384
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,848
Homer, I owe you one, buddy.

385
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,187
No sooner had I shaved off
the old cookie duster

386
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,750
than a lady cast me
in a commercial.

387
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,353
These checks keep coming--
It's criminal.

388
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,057
You dirty bast..!

389
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,528
What do you think,
Lisa?

390
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,866
How's the dog
supposed to get in?

391
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,371
Well, he just goes...

392
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,667
Ohh!

393
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,978
Oh, Woodrow,
how could you stand me up?

394
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,714
Mrs. K.,
you don't need him.

395
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:39,222
There are plenty
of good men around.

396
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,315
Name one.

397
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,292
What's wrong
with Principal Skinner?

398
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,657
Seymour? Hmph.

399
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:46,720
Let's just say his mommy
won't let him out to play.

400
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,459
What about Coach Fortner?

401
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,000
Glug, glug, glug, glug...

402
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,330
Wow.

403
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,894
What about groundskeeper Willy?

404
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,907
Ugh! I won't even tell you
what that guy's into.

405
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,843
Bart, you are the closest
thing to a man in my life

406
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:04,678
and that's so depressing
I think I'm to cry.

407
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,722
Aah..!

408
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,692
Oh, fudge... That's broken.

409
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,352
Fiddle-dee-dee.

410
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,863
That will require
a tetanus shot.

411
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:22,365
I'm not going to swear

412
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,765
but I am going

413
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:26,133
to kick this doghouse down!

414
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,107
Dad, this is not
a commentary on your skills

415
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,269
but we bought you
a new doghouse.

416
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,642
With what money?

417
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,874
There was plenty
in the swear jar

418
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:40,884
and inside the doghouse,
there's a little surprise.

419
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,009
Maggie.

420
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,077
Oh, cute.

421
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:45,486
No, behind her.

422
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,647
Beer!

423
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,626
How did you know?

424
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,491
Where's Maggie?

425
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,326
Where's Maggie?

426
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,161
There's Maggie!

427
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,163
Mom, this is a little
ahead of schedule

428
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:02,672
but I need help
with my love life.

429
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,336
Oh, my special little guy
has a sweetheart.

430
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,838
I knew it!

431
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,642
Who's your girlfriend?

432
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:11,977
Mrs. Krabappel.

433
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,608
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

434
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,179
Bart, this is your teacher?

435
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,348
I'll start going
to parents' night.

436
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,357
Homer!

437
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,825
You did a cruel thing.

438
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:25,624
Boy, you've got to go
to your teacher

439
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,187
and tell her
the truth.

440
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:29,529
No, that would
humiliate her.

441
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,695
<i>I thought that's what you
wanted to hear.</i>

442
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,069
Let's write her
another letter

443
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,904
that says good-bye,
but let's her feel loved.

444
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,466
Step aside, everyone.

445
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:42,377
Sensitive love letters
are my specialty.

446
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:46,042
''Dear baby,
Welcome to Dumpville.

447
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:48,051
Population: You.''

448
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,882
We'll all help.

449
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:53,219
''Though I'll be inoculating
babies in Kampuchea

450
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,724
my heart is with you.''

451
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,055
That sucks.

452
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,721
How about ''Crocodiles
bit off my face''?

453
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,391
That's disgusting,
and besides

454
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,902
when a woman loves a man,
that wouldn't matter.

455
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,301
I may hold you
to that, Marge.

456
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,068
''I cannot see you
for the next five years

457
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,905
for I will be farming
the ocean floor.''

458
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,338
''I must finish
this letter quickly

459
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:19,076
for I have only
four minutes to live.''

460
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,176
Three simple worlds:
''I am gay.''

461
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:25,518
Homer, for the last time,
I am not putting that.

462
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,024
''And anytime I hear
the wind blow

463
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,028
<i>it will whisper
the name... Edna. ''</i>

464
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,996
Oh, that's
very good, Lisa.

465
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,759
''P.S.: I am gay.''

466
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:37,791
How shall we end it?

467
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,963
How about, ''With a love that
will echo through the ages.''

468
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,404
Aww.
Ooh!

469
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,634
That's sweet.

470
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,699
Homer, you old
honey dripper.

471
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,211
Why, you little...
Hee, hee.

472
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,380
Huh?

473
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,559
Wait!

474
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,593
Wait!

475
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:08,899
<i>''Dearest Edna,
I must leave you.</i>

476
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,060
<i>Why? I cannot say.</i>

477
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,570
<i>Where? You cannot know.</i>

478
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:15,401
<i>How I will get there</i>

479
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,941
<i>I haven't decided yet.</i>

480
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,909
<i>But one thing I can tell you</i>

481
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,071
<i>any time I hear the wind blow</i>

482
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,843
<i>it will whisper
the name... Edna. ''</i>

483
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,474
Ohh..!

484
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,518
Bart, it's such
a nice day today.

485
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:33,853
Let's have detention
outside.

486
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,358
It's a date.

487
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:53,785
- Shh!
