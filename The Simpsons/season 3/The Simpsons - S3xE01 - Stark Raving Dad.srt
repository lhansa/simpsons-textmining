<i>## The Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:38,997
D'oh!

3
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:57,959
Bart.

4
00:00:58,036 --> 00:00:59,333
Bart!

5
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:00,894
Hey, Bart.

6
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,539
Lisa! It's 6:00 a.m.

7
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:08,546
Something's wrong.
Dad died.

8
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:10,775
No, no, he's fine.

9
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:12,214
What do you know?

10
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,216
I'm relieved.

11
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,014
My birthday's in two days.

12
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:16,679
I'll be eight years old.

13
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:17,779
It's a big number--

14
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:19,016
almost double digits.

15
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:20,353
Enjoy it while you can.

16
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:22,893
Everything changes
when you hit the big 1 -0.

17
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:24,053
Your legs go.

18
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,858
Candy doesn't taste as good.

19
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:27,922
Let me pour my little heart out.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,092
Sorry.

21
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,362
This old-timer does
ramble on sometimes.

22
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:34,371
I do so much for you
and you have disappointed me...

23
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,066
- on all my birthdays.
- Okay.

24
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:37,904
I've made things for you--

25
00:01:37,976 --> 00:01:39,238
Okay, okay, okay!

26
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:40,300
It's done.

27
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,279
Birthday gift
coming your way!

28
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:43,939
Oh, thank you.

29
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:46,416
Bart, watch Maggie
while I get the laundry.

30
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:47,509
Can do.

31
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:49,816
Hmm, Krusty Hotline.

32
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:54,350
Hi, kids!

33
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:56,519
You've reached
the Krusty Hotline.

34
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:59,530
If you haven't asked
your parents' permission--

35
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:00,587
naughty, naughty...

36
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,190
but Krusty forgives you.

37
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,201
Two dollars
for the first minute...

38
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:06,703
50 cents
for each additional minute.

39
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:19,944
Thanks for calling, kids.

40
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:21,610
A new message every day.

41
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:22,745
Maggie!

42
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:25,722
Bart, I asked you
to watch your sister.

43
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,316
I tried to stop her,
but she overpowered me.

44
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:30,657
Who stole my shirt?
Who stole my shirt?!

45
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:31,718
I washed it.

46
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:33,059
Thank you, Marge.

47
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:33,927
Ahh!

48
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:34,931
Pink?!

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,934
I can't wear
pink to work.

50
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:38,401
Everybody wears white.

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,734
I'm not popular enough
to be different.

52
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:42,740
You have plenty
of white shirts.

53
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:44,241
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme.

54
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,901
Oh, no! Pink!

55
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:48,070
<i>Pink! Pink!</i>

56
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:50,876
It's all over, Marge!

57
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,348
It's all over!

58
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,476
I don't know how this happened.

59
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,145
Ah, my lucky red hat.

60
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:57,688
Clean as a whistle.

61
00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:00,020
<i>You did this to me!</i>

62
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,684
I... apologize.

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,193
No one will notice...

64
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:05,320
if you wear
a pink shirt to work.

65
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:08,725
Wait a minute.

66
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,461
Go back.

67
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,025
Zoom in.

68
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,265
Why is that man in pink?!

69
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:16,807
That's Homer Simpson--
a boob from Sector 7-G.

70
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,105
Judging by his
outlandish attire...

71
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:22,203
he's some sort
of freethinking anarchist.

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,872
I'll call security, sir.

73
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,143
Excellent.

74
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:26,650
Yes, these color monitors...

75
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:28,652
have already paid
for themselves.

76
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,621
Pink! I don't get
his statement.

77
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,385
Shh, shh, shh.
Coming.

78
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,618
Hey, Homer...

79
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:36,058
we saved you a doughnut.

80
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:38,062
<i>It has pink frosting.</i>

81
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,559
Thanks.

82
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:41,724
It looks--

83
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,062
Hey, wait a minute!

84
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,069
Just because I'm wearing pink...

85
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:48,504
doesn't mean I'm some kind
of pink doughnut-eater...

86
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:50,165
although it is tempting.

87
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:52,335
Drop that doughnut.

88
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:54,743
Let's go, pinky.

89
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,144
You don't understand.

90
00:03:56,214 --> 00:04:00,014
My son just threw his red hat in
with the white laundry.

91
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,781
Spare me the tiresome antics
of the Simpson family.

92
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:04,014
Take him away.

93
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:06,887
His body cavity search
revealed nothing.

94
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,324
We must have X-rayed him
a hundred times.

95
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:11,123
Maybe he's telling the truth.

96
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:12,527
Or you're in cahoots.

97
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:15,896
I recall you had a penchant
for bell-bottomed trousers...

98
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,127
back in '7 9.

99
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:19,727
That was my costume
for the plant production...

100
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:20,737
<i>of H.M.S. Pinafore.</i>

101
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:21,864
Yes, of course.

102
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,374
Your spirited hornpipe
stole the show.

103
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:25,933
Doctor, what should we do...

104
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,706
about our
freewheeling fop?

105
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,043
It used to be that
establishing sanity...

106
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:31,173
took months.

107
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:32,273
That's all changed...

108
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,284
thanks to the Marvin Monroe...

109
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:36,286
Take-Home Personality Test.

110
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:38,618
20 simple questions
that will determine...

111
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,717
<i>just how crazy
or ''meshuggener'' someone is.</i>

112
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,227
''Print name.''

113
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:46,059
Oh!

114
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:51,166
Hmm.

115
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:52,828
Hmm!

116
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:55,835
Honey, do me a favor.

117
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:57,272
Fill out this form.

118
00:04:57,342 --> 00:05:00,004
This is an intimate
psychological profile.

119
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:02,012
I can't fill this out
for you.

120
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,342
All right, all right.

121
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:04,848
I'll get Lisa to do it.

122
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,713
Lisa, you like homework.

123
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,616
Could you fill out
this form?

124
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:09,619
Well, all right...

125
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,349
if you listen to my poem.

126
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,947
D-ohh! Okay.

127
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:16,187
'''Meditations on Turning Eight'
by Lisa Simpson.

128
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:18,058
I had a cat named Snowball.

129
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,391
She died, she died!

130
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:22,228
Mom said she was sleeping.

131
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,200
She lied, she lied!

132
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:26,294
Why, oh, why is my cat dead?

133
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:29,067
Couldn't that Chrysler
hit me instead?

134
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,199
I had a hamster named Snuffy--''

135
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:32,243
No deal.

136
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,868
Dad, you should do this.

137
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:35,037
It's no different...

138
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,377
than the time
I let you vote for me.

139
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,314
Remember
that absentee ballot?

140
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:40,408
Oh, yeah.

141
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,579
Our $50,000 home video
finalists are:

142
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:45,953
''Man Breaking Hip.''

143
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:48,819
''Dog on Fire.''

144
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:51,624
Ruff!.
Anyone order a hot dog?

145
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,396
Look at him!

146
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:58,095
And finally,
''Baby With a Nail Gun.''

147
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,067
Aw.

148
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,003
It's time to cast your votes.

149
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:03,097
''Dog on Fire!''
''Dog on Fire!''

150
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:04,539
Do you hear voices?

151
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,578
I'm hearing one now,
though I'm trying to watch TV.

152
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,409
Yes. Are you quick to anger?

153
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,642
Bart, shut up
or I'll shut you up!

154
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,650
Yes. Do you wet your pants?

155
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:18,485
Even the best of us
has an occasional accident.

156
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:19,649
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

157
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:21,692
So did I pass?

158
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,421
No.

159
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:24,484
Bart!

160
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:25,689
Careful, men.

161
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:27,493
He wets his pants.

162
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,764
Uhh...

163
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:35,032
the devil with his fly open.

164
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:36,368
Right.

165
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,205
A spill on the floor
with bugs going after it.

166
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:41,302
Good.

167
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:42,311
The boy!

168
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,438
This isn't fair!

169
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:45,244
How can you tell
who's sane...

170
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,614
and who's insane?

171
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:48,550
We have a very simple method.

172
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:52,789
Whoever has that stamp
on his hand is insane.

173
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:55,792
<i>Put him in with
the big white guy...</i>

174
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,488
<i>who thinks he's
the little black guy.</i>

175
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:05,831
Who are you?

176
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,633
I'm MichaelJackson
from theJacksons.

177
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:10,072
I'm Homer Simpson
from the Simpsons.

178
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,766
I can't believe you never heard of me.
I'm a very popular entertainer.

179
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,805
Of course,
I've heard of you.

180
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,398
You'd have to be
living under a rock--

181
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,567
What's your name?

182
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,405
MichaelJackson.

183
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,466
Doesn't ring a bell.

184
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,012
Heard of MTV or Motown?

185
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,569
No.

186
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,170
''Beat It''?

187
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:28,771
You beat it.

188
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,405
''Thriller''?

189
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,141
What was that?

190
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:30,978
- ''Thriller.''
- No.

191
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,039
How about this?

192
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,315
# BillyJean is not my lover #

193
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:40,087
# She's just a girl
who says that I am the one #

194
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,095
# But the kid is not my son #

195
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,596
# Hee-hee-hee ##

196
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,597
Wow!

197
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,293
How do your feet do that?

198
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,528
The moonwalk?

199
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,796
No, your feet!

200
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,599
Raise your heel a bit.

201
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,436
Put a little pressure
on the ball of your foot.

202
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,566
Uh-huh.

203
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,701
Huh?

204
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,766
D'oh!

205
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,774
You seem like a nice guy.

206
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,145
Why are you here?

207
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,877
I wore a pink shirt.

208
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,111
I understand.

209
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,210
People thought I dressed crazy.

210
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:08,879
What did you wear?

211
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:09,887
One white glove...

212
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,253
covered with rhinestones.

213
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,026
<i>##...and Scratchy Show ##</i>

214
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,846
In the split second
before he died...

215
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,906
I bet Scratchy appreciated
his birthday present.

216
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,646
Do you see how this relates
to us?

217
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,881
You want that once-a-year
empty gesture?

218
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:43,923
You got it.

219
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,752
Hey, Michael,
I don't get it.

220
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,421
These guys seem as normal
as you and me.

221
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,929
Homer, this is Floyd.

222
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,363
He's an idiot savant.

223
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,765
He can multiply
any two numbers...

224
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,928
in his head just like that.

225
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,096
Five times nine.

226
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,104
Forty-five.

227
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,105
Wow!

228
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,773
This guy is the chief.

229
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,004
He's been here since 1 968.

230
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,273
Never says a word.

231
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,439
Hey, Chief.

232
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,106
Hello.

233
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,414
It's about time
somebody reach out to me.

234
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,614
Gee, I got to call my family.

235
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,288
This is embarrassing
calling from a nuthouse.

236
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,851
They think I'm a god.

237
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,987
I could call for you.

238
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,121
Oh, great.

239
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,792
Tell them this is
one of those places...

240
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,960
where rich women
lose weight.

241
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,204
Joe's Crematorium.
You kill 'em, we grill 'em.

242
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,705
Hello. Who is this?

243
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,639
Bart Simpson.
Who are you?

244
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,801
I'm MichaelJackson.

245
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,071
<i>The MichaelJackson?</i>

246
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,271
No way.

247
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,610
I'm with your father
in a mental institution.

248
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,411
Is Elvis with you?

249
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,416
He could be.

250
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,350
It's a big hospital.

251
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,320
If you're really MichaelJackson...

252
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,823
who were your
last four Grammy dates?

253
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,189
Brooke Shields, Diana Ross,
Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles.

254
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,820
<i>Shiver me timbers!
You are MichaelJackson!</i>

255
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,364
Can you stay on the line while I get
all my friends and relatives?

256
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,364
I'm afraid not.

257
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,401
Your father needs your help.

258
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,335
You don't want him
to get a lobotomy, do you?

259
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,872
<i>Hmm... lobotomy.</i>

260
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,836
That's all right, son.

261
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,006
There's probably a downside
I don't see.

262
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,174
Uh-huh.

263
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,512
New Bedlam Asylum.

264
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,516
Loves us.

265
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,517
Needs us.

266
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,020
Fears he may never see us again.

267
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,681
MichaelJackson, whoo-hoo!

268
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,019
I love you, man.

269
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,389
Hey, Mom...

270
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,690
Dad's in a mental institution.

271
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,854
Oh, my God.

272
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,192
Mother was right.

273
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,896
Don't you worry.

274
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,300
Your family
will be here soon.

275
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,464
The only way out
ain't pretty.

276
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,529
What's that?

277
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,074
Dating a nurse.

278
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,305
I knew you'd send your father
to the crazy house.

279
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,846
You said poorhouse.

280
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,074
I said crazy house!

281
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:49,671
Poorhouse.

282
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,511
Crazy house!

283
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,174
Poorhouse.

284
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,444
Crazy house!

285
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,985
Hello, you've reached...

286
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,988
the New Bedlam
Wrongly-Committed Hotline.

287
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,650
All our operators
are currently busy.

288
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,317
Please stay on the line.

289
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,664
What's wrong, Homer?

290
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,168
This place is so strange.

291
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,003
Mike, I'm ashamed
to admit it to another guy...

292
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,601
but I'm... scared.

293
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,839
We all get scared sometimes.

294
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,847
Maybe I can help you.

295
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,142
Hot cakes...

296
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,802
football...

297
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,642
boobies--

298
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,150
Bubbles,
it's going to be a long night.

299
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:04,018
Please express yourselves.

300
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:08,051
In these sessions, we want you
to feel relaxed and uninhibited.

301
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,654
I was working
at an insurance company.

302
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:13,428
Youngest V.P. In the history
of the firm.

303
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,093
The job was my life.

304
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,435
Then one Monday morning,
I couldn't leave the house.

305
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,098
Was the door locked?

306
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:22,837
I just couldn't face
what was out there.

307
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,639
Was it raining?

308
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:24,770
No, Homer...

309
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,178
Dave suffers
from agoraphobia--

310
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,546
a fear of open areas
and crowds.

311
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:30,879
Dave, go on.

312
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:34,353
I knew I just couldn't make
that long drive to work.

313
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:35,616
Were you out of gas?

314
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,588
Baby.

315
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,925
Your husband suffers
from a persecution complex...

316
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:45,295
extreme paranoia
and bladder hostility.

317
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,858
If you talk to him
without mentioning Bart...

318
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,733
you'd see how sane he is.

319
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:52,637
You mean there really is
a Bart? Good Lord!

320
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:53,969
Mmm, pancakes.

321
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:57,102
Oh, Mr. Simpson,
you've got a visitor.

322
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:58,270
D'oh!

323
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:00,546
Marge!

324
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,207
Oh, Homie!

325
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,286
After talking to your wife...

326
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:12,349
we believe you're no threat
to yourself or others.

327
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:15,919
That's the most flattering thing
anyone ever said to me.

328
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,828
Could I have it in writing?

329
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,264
''Not insane.''

330
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,767
Hmm.

331
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:22,632
I'm proud of you, Homer.

332
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:25,798
Michael, you really helped me
get through this.

333
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:28,365
If you ever find your marbles,
come visit us.

334
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:30,741
How about today?
I'm here voluntarily.

335
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,006
You are? Why?

336
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,945
In 1 97 9, I got real depressed...

337
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,676
<i>when my Off the Wall album...</i>

338
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,082
just got one lousy
Grammy nomination.

339
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,440
Joe's Taxidermy.
You snuff'em, we stuff'em.

340
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,169
Boy, when I get home...

341
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:05,007
I'm going to wrap my hands
around your neck...

342
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,979
and smother you with kisses.

343
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:09,778
Whatever they got you on,
cut the dose.

344
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:11,944
I'm bringing
MichaelJackson home...

345
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,544
for a few days.

346
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:16,021
Isn't that cute?
He's heard of you.

347
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,548
Make sure we have cold cuts,
and put some beer on ice--

348
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,959
I'm a vegetarian,
and I don't drink.

349
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,590
Are you sure
you're here voluntarily?

350
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,690
Yes.

351
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:26,756
Please make sure...

352
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:28,860
he doesn't tell anybody
I'm coming.

353
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:31,030
Yes, Dad, I solemnly swear...

354
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,573
I will not tell
another living soul--

355
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,541
No, not even Milhouse.

356
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,544
Huh?

357
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,139
Hello, Milhouse?

358
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:43,116
Can you keep a secret?

359
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:43,775
No.

360
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:45,114
MichaelJackson...

361
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,585
is coming to my house!

362
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,246
MichaelJackson?!

363
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:49,847
MichaelJackson?!

364
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:51,118
MichaelJackson?!

365
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,921
Aunt Bella?! Wait a minute.

366
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:54,962
I got a call on the other line.

367
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,291
MichaelJackson?!

368
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:57,524
MichaelJackson?!

369
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,793
MichaelJackson?!

370
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,061
MichaelJackson?!

371
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:03,069
MichaelJackson?!

372
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:06,300
We've just been handed a bulletin
from our Rock 'n' Rumor department.

373
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:10,811
MichaelJackson is moonwalking
his way to Springfield.

374
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,347
While we check it out...

375
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,678
why don't you enjoy
a seldom-heard...

376
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,685
extra-long version
of''In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.''

377
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:20,186
MichaelJackson!

378
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:23,053
Such a thing happens
once in a blue moon.

379
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,024
Do I dare leave my post?

380
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,500
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

381
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,235
Uh, this is
the most exciting thing...

382
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,365
to happen to our fair town...

383
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:44,104
since the Dalai Lama visited
in 1 952

384
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:46,976
and so, I hereby declare
that Route 401

385
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:50,040
currently known
as the Dalai Lama Expressway...

386
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:54,214
will henceforth be known as
the MichaelJackson Expressway.

387
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:56,052
I think I can see him.

388
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:58,149
Oh, here he comes. Oh!

389
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:04,423
The guy in the pink shirt
is the father of the family...

390
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,525
who was just released
from a mental hospital.

391
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,093
Thanks, everybody.
It's great to be sane.

392
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:11,468
We want Michael!

393
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,006
We want Michael!

394
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:14,098
We want Michael!

395
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:15,073
Here he is.

396
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:16,735
Here's the guy...

397
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,438
you want to see!

398
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:19,138
Aahh!

399
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,579
Huh? Huh?

400
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:25,914
He's 300 pounds.

401
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,079
He's white.

402
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:28,986
He's dressed without flair.

403
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,392
What made me think...

404
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:37,329
MichaelJackson would even visit
this jerkwater burg?

405
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:39,366
You owe us
MichaelJackson.

406
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:43,370
Don't ever show your face
around here again, you tool.

407
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:48,473
Bart, the entire town
is howling for your blood...

408
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:51,637
and before I join them,
I have one question.

409
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:53,647
Today is my birthday.

410
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:56,980
You promised
you'd get me something and...

411
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,042
and I'm afraid to ask.

412
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,214
Maybe you should trust
that instinct and not ask.

413
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,087
I thought so.

414
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:06,388
Oh, Bart, you--

415
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:15,129
Come off!.

416
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:16,795
I'm sane now.

417
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:20,304
Dear Bart...

418
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,367
I am using the stationery
Mom and Dad gave me...

419
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:24,877
<i>for my birthday...</i>

420
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:29,007
to inform you that we are now
brother and sister in name only.

421
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,517
Perhaps,
if a professional so advises...

422
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,349
I will give you a hug...

423
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,685
at some far distant
family reunion...

424
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,851
but rest assured,
it will be purely for show.

425
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,863
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

426
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:46,627
Hey, Bart.

427
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,066
<i>Hey, you.</i>

428
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:50,468
When I was a kid,
I didn't have much money.

429
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,870
You know what I did when my
sisters' birthdays rolled around?

430
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,032
Stiffed them?

431
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:57,236
No. I wrote them a song
to show that I cared.

432
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,711
I can't write a song.
I'm only ten.

433
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:02,875
When I was your age
I had six gold records.

434
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,579
Hey, Looney Tunes, this is
what MichaelJackson looks like.

435
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:09,282
You look like
a big, fat mental patient.

436
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:10,688
I often hear that.

437
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,248
Just leave me alone.

438
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,260
Either MichaelJackson
is working...

439
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,421
in a recording studio in L.A...

440
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:19,762
or he's here with you
willing to work on this song.

441
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,426
It's your choice.

442
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:22,764
So long.

443
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,361
Wait, wait, Michael!

444
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:27,772
Go sit at the piano,
and I'll boil some coffee.

445
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:30,675
<i>## [ Singing To Theme From
Bridge on the River Kwai ]</i>

446
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,852
Uh, no.

447
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,826
Bart, we've got to get...

448
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:49,692
to your real feelings
about your sister.

449
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:51,026
I don't have any.

450
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,532
Let's go look at her.

451
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,067
Maybe that will help.

452
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:56,660
Oh, she looks sad.

453
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:59,901
That's 'cause she knows
you're looking at her.

454
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:04,070
Although I know you're looking
at me, I would look exactly
the same, even if you weren't.

455
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:09,049
Bart, think.

456
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:11,085
What happens to you...

457
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:12,744
when you turn eight?

458
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,846
Well, your training wheels
come off your bike.

459
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:17,185
Good. That's good.

460
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:25,959
You're just
putting that in...

461
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,728
because it's commercial.

462
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,412
- Lisa.
- Lisa.

463
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,417
- Lisa.
- Lisa.

464
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:47,477
- Lisa.
- Lisa.

465
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:53,760
What, Bart? It's 6:00 a.m.

466
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,261
That's right.

467
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,354
Hope you like
your present.

468
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,428
And a-one and a-two
and a-one, two, three, four.

469
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:03,596
Yeah!

470
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:06,690
Oh, this is
the best present I ever got!

471
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,701
Thank you, Bart.
Thank you, Michael.

472
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,532
My work is done here.

473
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,368
What happened
to your voice?

474
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,101
This is my real voice.

475
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:15,642
I'm Leon Compowski.

476
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,940
I'm a bricklayer
from New Jersey.

477
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:20,412
All my life I was angry,
until one day...

478
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:22,813
I talked like this.

479
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:25,079
All of a sudden...

480
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:27,052
everybody was
smiling at me.

481
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:28,986
So, I kept on doing it.

482
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:32,389
To make a tired point,
which one of us is truly crazy?

483
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,690
Not me. I got this.

484
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,389
Bye-bye, Leon.

485
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:38,830
You're a credit to dementia.

486
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:31,286
<i>Take it away, Lise.</i>

487
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:54,578
Hoo!

488
00:22:54,651 --> 00:22:56,118
Shh!
