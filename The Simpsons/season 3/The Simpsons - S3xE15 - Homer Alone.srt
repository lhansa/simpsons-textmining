<i>## The Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:07,381
D'oh!

3
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:45,338
I am not cleaning that.

4
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:47,041
Mmm, who am I kidding?

5
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,645
Now, Maggie...

6
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:55,353
when you grow up...

7
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,791
you can suck your pacifier
all you want.

8
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,196
Extra mustard for Bart's...

9
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:09,431
sliced diagonally.

10
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,030
Light mayo for Lisa,
cut off the crust.

11
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,769
Double bologna for Homer...

12
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:14,775
- Mom--
- Mom--

13
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,038
Can you sign my--

14
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:17,909
Where's my lucky red cap?

15
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,971
I hate those pimento things--

16
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,209
I split my pants again.

17
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:23,149
Ooh! Can I have
two sandwiches?

18
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,584
I got a test today--

19
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:25,951
I can't eat those--

20
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,614
One at a time!

21
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,282
One at a time!

22
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,284
- Double bologna!
- No pimentos!

23
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,091
- Don't forget to make it--
- Mom, where's my--

24
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:36,654
That's enough!

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,961
There you go, Lisa--
no pimentos.

26
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:41,867
Bart, your hat's
behind the toilet.

27
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:44,702
Homer, I'll sew your pants,
but I'm out of bologna.

28
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:45,706
- Thanks, Mom.
- Thanks, Mom.

29
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:46,707
D'oh!

30
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:47,800
Videos to return...

31
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,243
grocery list,
flea dip for the cat...

32
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:51,405
dry cleaning--

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,072
I think that's everything.

34
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,480
Marge, can you take...

35
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,744
my ball to Nick's?

36
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:58,048
A bottle cap got lodged
in the finger hole.

37
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,314
I'm running late.

38
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,822
Can't you use a ball at the alley?

39
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,825
Ohh, alley balls?

40
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,258
All right. Don't whine.

41
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:07,421
Just put it in my left hand.

42
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:11,995
Kids, hurry up or you're
going to miss your bus.

43
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:13,763
- No way.
- Never happen.

44
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:17,932
Well, I'll be damned.

45
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:25,609
Bart's making faces at me.

46
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:28,775
It's a nervous twitch,
and I'm sensitive about it...

47
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,842
if you don't mind.

48
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:41,595
Get... out!

49
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,960
Fruit leather...

50
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:50,904
Tree Fresh
imitation orange drink...

51
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:53,567
Krusty brand
duck sausage pizza--

52
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,478
You've got the wrong Nick's.

53
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:00,640
You want Nick's...

54
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:02,547
on the other side of town.

55
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,280
I don't know what
Nicky's telling you.

56
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:07,549
I haven't flushed a ball
in years.

57
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:15,587
Oh, this miserable stress headache.

58
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:18,327
Feels like there's a rat
in my brain!

59
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:21,268
It's time for
another Bill and Marty...

60
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:23,601
classic crank call.

61
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:26,164
Hello, Mr.Justin Sherman?

62
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:27,266
Yes.

63
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:28,776
Your wife is dead.

64
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:30,038
Oh, God, no!

65
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:32,171
That's right.

66
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:35,183
She just walked through
a plate glass window.

67
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,116
There's blood everywhere.

68
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:38,778
I just talked to her.

69
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,293
<i>Bart's making faces.</i>

70
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:49,626
<i>Where's my red cap?</i>

71
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:50,563
<i>Alley balls?</i>

72
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:51,895
<i>Your wife is dead.</i>

73
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,958
<i>I haven't flushed a ball
in years.</i>

74
00:04:57,707 --> 00:05:00,938
Noooo!!

75
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,581
Lady, this better be good.

76
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:23,595
This is Arnie Pie
with Arnie in the Sky.

77
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,928
We've got big problems...

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,093
on the Springfield
Memorial Bridge.

79
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,865
<i>Traffic going waaay back
in both directions.</i>

80
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,736
And look out at 1 4th and Elm.

81
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,297
I just dropped my bagel.

82
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:37,610
She's locked in the car
and refuses to move.

83
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,443
Did you flash your lights?

84
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:40,607
Yes.

85
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:42,708
Well, I'm fresh out of ideas.

86
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:43,774
All right!

87
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:46,617
A chance to catch some rays.

88
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,124
Come on! Come on!

89
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,558
I got a body in the trunk.

90
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,631
Mr. Genie, stop fiddling
with the buttons.

91
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,067
Oh! You've gotten chocolate
all over everything.

92
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:02,570
This is Kent Brockman...

93
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:05,072
reporting from Arnie Pie's
traffic 'copter...

94
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:07,405
but this is no mere
traffic report.

95
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:08,408
Hey!

96
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:09,739
Face the facts.

97
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:13,509
An overworked
and underappreciated housewife...

98
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,608
has parked on the bridge,
refusing to budge.

99
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:19,586
This reporter will be lowered
in the sky harness...

100
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,555
for an exclusive interview.

101
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:24,215
Huh?

102
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:26,418
Ow!

103
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:27,962
Hey!

104
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,759
Ow!

105
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,133
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

106
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:35,602
Not getting enough
of the good stuff?

107
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,194
D'oh!

108
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:46,930
Let me through.

109
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:48,094
I'm her husband.

110
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,603
That explains a lot.

111
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:53,766
Try to talk her
out of there...

112
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:55,673
but don't put
your lips on it.

113
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:56,676
Hello.

114
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:57,677
Hello!

115
00:06:57,746 --> 00:06:58,940
Is this thing on?

116
00:06:59,014 --> 00:06:59,946
Hello?!

117
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,676
Homer, is that you?

118
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,012
What should I say?

119
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:04,780
How about, ''Yes, it's me''?

120
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:06,115
Yes, it's me.

121
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,780
Tell her you love her.

122
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:09,448
I love you very much.

123
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:10,787
Awww.

124
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:12,121
And, uh...

125
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:15,129
later tonight,
I think you and I should, uh...

126
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:16,459
snuggle?

127
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:19,793
Ha, ha!

128
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:22,462
Uh, why don't you
just wrap it up?

129
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,904
I can tell something's
bothering you...

130
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,964
but if you come out
of that car...

131
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:29,203
I promise to do
whatever it takes...

132
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:30,472
to make it better.

133
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:32,605
Please, honey?

134
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:34,273
Okay.

135
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:41,684
Cuff her, boys!

136
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:49,625
Off the record, ma'am...

137
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,598
all the gals on the force...

138
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,225
knew just how you felt.

139
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:54,428
That's nice.

140
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,562
Could you loosen my cuffs?

141
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:57,229
No.

142
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,297
Don't worry.

143
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,139
She'll be cracking rocks
by the end of the week.

144
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,145
You glorified night watchman...

145
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:05,145
let her go!

146
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:06,306
But she broke the law.

147
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,247
Thanks for the civics lesson.

148
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:10,182
If Marge Simpson goes to jail...

149
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:12,379
I can kiss the chick vote
good-bye...

150
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:15,150
and if I go down,
you're breaking my fall!

151
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:18,591
Quimby, don't write checks
your butt can't cash.

152
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,288
Hear me, Wiggum,
you bite me, I'll bite back.

153
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:24,423
You talk the talk, Quimby,
but do you walk the walk?

154
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,334
I hereby declare today
to be Marge Simpson day...

155
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:30,133
in the city of Springfield.

156
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,066
They're like seals--
toss 'em a fish...

157
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:37,305
and watch 'em slap
their fins together.

158
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:43,076
Well, all's well
that ends well.

159
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:46,588
Good night, Marge.

160
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:51,823
Many years ago...

161
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:54,920
the Spanish explorers discovered
their piece of heaven...

162
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:57,192
nestled
in the Springfield Mountains.

163
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,995
They called it Rancho Relaxo...

164
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,557
and so do we.

165
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:04,333
Today, it's Springfield's
only two-star health spa.

166
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:05,395
Swim, play tennis...

167
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:08,238
or just sit
and stare at the walls.

168
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,006
At Rancho Relaxo,
you're the boss.

169
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,379
Remember, you can't spell Relaxo
without relax.

170
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:18,918
Homer?

171
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,353
- Homer!
- What?

172
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:22,583
I need a vacation.

173
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:23,852
What?!

174
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:26,156
But, Marge,
we just had a vacation.

175
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:27,786
Remember Mystic Caverns?

176
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:30,293
I need to unwind.

177
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:31,696
I know you do, Marge...

178
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,600
but you know what
our vacations are like.

179
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,001
Those three monsters
in the backseat--

180
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:38,562
''Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?''

181
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,972
And I'm no day
at the beach either.

182
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:43,443
'' Marge, can I have
another sandwich?

183
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:45,878
Marge, can I have
another sandwich?''

184
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:46,880
No, I mean...

185
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:48,610
a vacation by myself.

186
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:49,946
What?!

187
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:52,179
You mean we're getting
a divorce?

188
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:53,516
Marge, I can change.

189
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:54,817
No, Homie, no.

190
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,221
I still love you.

191
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,089
A lot of couples
take separate vacations.

192
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:00,321
Well, okay...

193
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:02,989
but you have to swear
you're coming back.

194
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:03,997
I swear.

195
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,499
All right, then.

196
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:12,335
Thanks for taking
the children while I'm away.

197
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,669
Don't worry yourself.

198
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:16,074
We've got six months
of maternity leave...

199
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:17,577
we'll never use anyway.

200
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:19,113
Homer, bring Maggie out.

201
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:27,316
Wish I'd thought of that.

202
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,026
She's starting to give.

203
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,186
Homer, if Maggie...

204
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:35,253
doesn't want to leave the house...

205
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,525
maybe she should just stay with you.

206
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,157
Are you sure that's wise?

207
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:40,792
He'll probably trade her...

208
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,860
for a beer and a nudie magazine.

209
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:47,140
For your information,
I can take care of my--

210
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,571
See? Got her on the first bounce.

211
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:53,137
All aboard for Shelbyville,
Badwater...

212
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:56,480
Cattle Skull Testing Grounds,
and Rancho Relaxo.

213
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:57,985
Good-bye, Homie.

214
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:00,180
Good-bye?
Where's my clean underwear?

215
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,244
Check the dryer.

216
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,291
How often should I change Maggie?

217
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,689
Whenever she needs it.

218
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,524
Marge, how do I use
the pressure cooker?

219
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:09,325
Don't!

220
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:21,108
Restful, easy listening.

221
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,336
Coming up next...

222
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:25,380

223
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,782
Hmm?

224
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:34,117
Hello, Maggie.

225
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:36,520
Sorry, honey.

226
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,457
Mommy went crazy...

227
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,620
and went far, far away...

228
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:43,927
so it's going to be
just you and me for a while.

229
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,626
Just you and me.

230
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,467
You haven't touched
your tongue sandwiches.

231
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:51,801
Are you thirsty?

232
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:54,637
We've got Clamato, Mr. Pibb,
and soy milk.

233
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,972
That's all right.

234
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:58,979
I think I'll just hit the hay.

235
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,639
It's 1 2:30 in the afternoon.

236
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:02,149
I'm aware of the time.

237
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:04,378
Lisa, you'll sleep in my bed.

238
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,478
Bart, you'll sleep with Aunt Patty.

239
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,318
- In your bed?
- Uh-huh.

240
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,652
And I should warn you...

241
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:10,817
I'm told I snore.

242
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:14,661
<i>Ooh, Divorce Court is on
in 1 5 minutes!</i>

243
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,665
I'm scared, Lisa.

244
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,530
<i>You think you know fear?</i>

245
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,660
Well, I've seen them naked.

246
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:27,874
Oh, hello...

247
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:30,173

You might remember me
from such films as...

250
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:39,411
<i>Today We Kill, Tomorrow We Die,
and Gladys, the Groovy Mule.</i>

251
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:42,218
But today you'll see me

252
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,226
your video tour guide
to Rancho Relaxo.

253
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,228
Our tour starts in your own room...

254

where Relaxo-vision offers you
the latest Hollywood hits...

255
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,299

Chef Roderigo,
what are you up to?

260
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,645
Taste for yourself, Troy.

261
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,651
Mm-mm-mmm!

262
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,312
That can't be good for me.

263
00:13:13,388 --> 00:13:14,650
It tastes too good.

264
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:16,190
That's where you're wrong.

265
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:20,558
This whole pot is only 1 4 calories.

266
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,663
Oh, Gregory...

267
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,962
where have you been all my life?

268
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:28,631
Feeling tense?

269
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:29,398
Uh-huh.

270
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,995
Then just push nine...

271
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:32,472
on your phone...

272
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,567
then the pound sign,
then 4-8-3.

273
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:36,906
We'll do the rest.

ohh... ahh...

284
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,211
Marge, it's times like this...

285
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:17,740
I'm glad I flunked out
of that Mexican med school.

286
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:18,808
Hi, Barney.

287
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:21,048
Thanks for keeping me company.

288
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:22,055
No problem.

289
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:23,386
Well, well.

290
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,824
If it isn't little Bart.

291
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:27,759
Remember your Uncle Barney?

292
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,820
Hey, Homer, let me hold him.

293
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:32,162
All right,
but just be careful.

294
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:35,829
Whoa! Someone smells stinky.

295
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:38,037
Oh, it's me.

296
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:40,173
Bart...

297
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:41,766
you shouldn't be looking...

298
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:43,777
through other people's things.

299
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,107

328
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,149
I've lost a baby.

I've ever done.

330

Don't worry.

331
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,319
You know what
I'm going to do?

332
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,158
I'm going to make you an omelet.

333
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,493
Just help me look.

334
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,657
Are you sure?

335
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,167
I make them
with two kinds of cheese.

336
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,432
Homer, I think I've got her.

337

Barney, you'll pull her arm off!.

339

The sooner I get her out...

340
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,407
the sooner we can have omelets.

341
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:38,828

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,924
Oh, dear God.

00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:42,629
I can't even put a bag

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,254
Hmm...

368
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:14,487
- Dad!
- Dad!

369
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:15,722
Hey, kids.

370
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:18,890
You haven't seen Maggie
around, have you?

371
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:20,831
- Hmm-mm.
- Hmm-mm.

372
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:23,426
Oh! Well, I got to go.

373
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,562
Come on, kids.

374
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:29,075
It's time to rub Aunt Patty's feet.

375
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:36,510
Hello, gov'nor.

376
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:38,313
Lube job while you wait?

377
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,444
Don't touch me.

378
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:47,856
Yello.

379
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:49,088
Hi, Homie.

380
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:50,926
I feel much better.

381
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:52,363
Listen, Marge... uh...

382
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:55,766
how would you feel
if I told you the dog ran away?

383
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:57,770
Homer, that's awful.

384
00:19:57,838 --> 00:19:59,703
Oh. Well, I got good news.

385
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:01,435
The dog didn't run away.

386
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:02,441
Well, good.

387
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,102
I'm coming home, honey.

388
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:06,203
You can pick me up in an hour...

389
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,577
and bring the kids.

390
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:08,580
Bye.

391
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:11,015
D'oh!

392
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,382
Please, don't jump.

393
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,183
I know you're going through
some tough times...

394
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,248
but you have your whole life
ahead of you.

395
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:22,385
Well, Marge...
Maggie was very young.

396
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:25,330
It's not like we got
so attached to her.

397
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,331
No.

398
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,992
Marge, isn't life funny?

399
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,502
One day, they're babies...

400
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,006
the next thing you know,
they're off on their own.

401
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,473
Did you report a lost baby?

402
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:38,102
Yes.

403
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:39,146
Describe her.

404
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:41,181
Uh, she's small...

405
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:42,510
she's a girl--

406
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,515
Bingo!

407
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:44,516
Oh, Maggie!

408
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:46,246
Not so fast.

409
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,346
You're wanted on three counts
of criminal neglect.

410
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:52,358
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

411
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:54,360
Shucks.

412
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:57,659
Just don't do it again,
you big lug.

413
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,735
You're not going anywhere.

414
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:26,989
Hi! Did you miss me?

415
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,831
Never leave again! Never leave again!

416
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:32,831
Never leave again.

417
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,834
I missed you too.

418
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,894
<i>From now on,
I hope you'll help me out.</i>

419
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:39,337
You got it, sweetheart.

420
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:40,998
You have enough blanket?

421
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:43,202
Well, I could use a little more.

422
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:46,371
And sometimes,
I want a little time to myself...

423
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:47,709
and I expect you--

424
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:48,840
Mom...

425
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,076
I think I speak...

426
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:51,812
for everyone in this bed...

427
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:54,684
<i>when I say you have
nothing to worry about.</i>

428
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:56,450
Now, let's just try and get...

429
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,855
a little shut-eye.

430
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:52,840
Shh!
