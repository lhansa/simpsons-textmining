00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:07,488
<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,390
D'oh!

3
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,768
Oh, ain't that cute?

4
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:33,271
Hey! Where in God's name
did you learn that kind of...

5
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:34,870
dancing?

6
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,050
Whoa.

7
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,244
Ooh.

8
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,718
Oh, yeah.

9
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:43,118
Can I have money...

10
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:45,123
to buy Bart
a birthday present?

11
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,783
Money.

12
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,953
- Dad, this is $1 1 0.
- Oh. Sorry.

13
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:51,462
That's righteous.

14
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,398
Funky See, Funky Do will be back
to lip-synch one of their hits...

15
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:56,833
right after this.

16
00:01:56,902 --> 00:02:00,065
Hey, kids,
why sit in front of the TV...

17
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,767
when you can be on the radio?

18
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:05,743
#We're gonna roll
this truckin' convoy #

19
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:07,938
#Across the U.S.A. #

20
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:10,574
# Convoy #

21
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,809
That could be Bart.

22
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:13,977
Throw away
your bulky transmitters...

23
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:15,020
and broadcasting towers.

24
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:17,146
The superstar
celebrity microphone...

25
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,657
lets you hear your voice
through any A.M. radio.

26
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:20,749
Hey, good-looking...

27
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:22,953
we'll be back
to pick you up later.

28
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,293
He's in for some loving.

29
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,958
It's the perfect gift
for birthdays, graduations...

30
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:28,966
board meetings.

31
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:30,093
You're fired.

32
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:31,761
Bart's birthday's coming up.

33
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:33,771
But order now,
supply is limited.

34
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,101
Limited!

35
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:38,007
Do you have
any of those microphones left?

36
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:40,102
Yeah, a couple.

37
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:43,444
Bart's really going to like
my birthday present this year.

38
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,780
It won't be like
those shoe trees...

39
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:47,113
I got him last year...

40
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:49,450
or the shelf paper
I bought him for Christmas.

41
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:50,887
I'll buy his love yet.

42
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:51,980
Mmm, yeah.

43
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,626
Okay, Sideshow Mel...

44
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,725
bring out the birthday cake.

45
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:13,510
Hey, kids...

46
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:14,807
while Sideshow Mel mops up...

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,245
let's see the names...

48
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:18,545
of our Krusty birthday pals
for today.

49
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,482
All right,
here comes my name.

50
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:23,716
Wow.

51
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,347
Best eight bucks I ever spent.

52
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:27,415
Bart, your grandpa's on the phone.

53
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:30,018
He wants
to wish you a happy birthday.

54
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:31,028
Isn't that nice?

55
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:32,257
Take a message.

56
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:35,095
Right now, I'm off
to hit 46 local merchants...

57
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,361
for free birthday...

58
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:37,925
goods and services.

59
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,767
I'm here for
my free birthday sundae.

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,740
Eat it and get out.

61
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:46,101
Digital audiotape, my butt.

62
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:48,772
When I was a kid,
we had compact discs...

63
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:50,372
and I don't recall
no one complaining.

64
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:51,473
Damn right.

65
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,052
Sorry, Rosarita.

66
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,423
I got to get
to my birthday party.

67
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:03,291
Farewell, Señor Bart.

68
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,724
Hey, good to see you.

69
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:11,736
Glad you could make it.

70
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:13,738
Toby, have you lost weight?

71
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:15,068
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

72
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:19,575
It's Wally!

73
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:23,411
Hey, Wally,
do something funny.

74
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:24,744
Hey, later, okay?

75
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:28,014
Hey, why don't you
go bug your parents?

76
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:30,351
Cool, Larry the Looter.

77
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:38,162
All right, stick it to the man.

78
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,306
Hey there.

79
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:52,708
I hear it's your birthday.

80
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:54,040
How old are you?

81
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:55,045
Well, I'm--

82
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:56,206
That's great.

83
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:58,716
Would you like us to
sing you a special song?

84
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:00,046
- Hell, no.
- You got it.

85
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,711
Ready, Señor Beaveratti?

86
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,049
I'm a-ready.

87
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:05,386
And a-one, and a-two...

88
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,721
#You're the birthday #

89
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:09,556
#You're the birthday #

90
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:13,394
#You're the birthday boy
or girl... #

91
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:25,871
What the...?

92
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:27,879
It's a label maker.

93
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:29,539
We have one at home.

94
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:30,912
Before we got it...

95
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,814
I was always
finding Patty's stubble...

96
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:34,079
in my leg razor.

97
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:45,059
Bart, I'll bet you think...

98
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,064
nothing's going
to top that cactus.

99
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,793
<i>Well, check out my present.</i>

100
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,031
Next.

101
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:53,867
Bart, be polite.

102
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,372
Next, please.

103
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:56,703
Bart, I've noticed...

104
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:59,869
your birthday presents
are a poor crop at best.

105
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:02,072
I hope this turns the tide.

106
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,481
Ooh,just gorgeous.

107
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:08,349
Now we can be twins.

108
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:26,097
There's only one beer left,
and it's Bart's.

109
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:28,401
Hey, boy,
how's the microphone working?

110
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:30,442
Fine.

111
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,740
Bart! I would love
to get a present like that.

112
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:34,744
Here you go.

113
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:35,745
Enjoy.

114
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:37,076
D'oh!

115
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:39,640
This is a great invention.
Watch.

116
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:41,913
#We got a great big convoy #

117
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:43,750
# Rocking through the night #

118
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:47,758
#We got a great big convoy
Ain't she a beautiful sight? #

119
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,225
# Convoy #

120
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:50,785
Quit it, Dad!

121
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:51,887
Hey, good-looking...

122
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:54,364
we'll be back
for some dinner later.

123
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:55,695
What did you say?

124
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:57,963
I can't understand you
with all that distortion.

125
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,697
What a crappy birthday.

126
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:04,368
I don't think
this is such a bad present.

127
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:08,573
Maybe you shouldn't talk into it
as loud as your father does.

128
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:10,706
Testing.

129
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,045
Testing one-two-three.

130
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,550
Oh, my.

131
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:15,086
Do I sound like that?

132
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:16,712
Hey, it does work.

133
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:20,054
I bet you could
have a lot of fun with this.

134
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,457
Why don't you
go show your father?

135
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,428
Mmm, chocolate.

136
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:27,727
D'oh!

137
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,427
Mmm, chocolate.

138
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:31,503
D'oh!

139
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,299
Marge, we need some more...

140
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,567
vanilla, chocolate
and strawberry ice cream.

141
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:38,735
<i> I'll get some
at the store tomorrow, Homer.</i>

142
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,403
Mmm, chocolate.

143
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,743
People of Earth, this is Bartron--

144
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:45,283
commander
of the Martian invasion force.

145
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:48,184
Your planet is in our hands.

146
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:50,983
Resistance is useless.

147
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:54,350
We have captured your president.

148
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:55,688
He was delicious.

149
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:56,750
Why, you little--

150
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:03,700
Oh...

151
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:04,861
just promise me...

152
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:07,303
you won't play
any more practical jokes.

153
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:08,704
I promise.

154
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:18,807
Mama. Mama.

155
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,112
Maggie, you talked!

156
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:23,676
Can you say ''Mama'' again?

157
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,016
Sorry, lady.

158
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,351
Show's over.

159
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,754
Oh, Bart.

160
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,250
I dreamed
I was married to Corey...

161
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,057
and we lived
on a pony farm...

162
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,325
and Corey was always
walking around...

163
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,764
with his shirt off.

164
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,636
Oh, brother.

165
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,472
Mrs. Crabapple,
that was uncalled for.

166
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:50,411
Bravo!

167
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,449
Well done, old man.

168
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,517
Hmm.

169
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:59,318
Rod, Tod, this is God.

170
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,482
How did you get on the radio?

171
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,389
What do you mean?

172
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,655
I created the universe,
stupid kids.

173
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:06,991
Forgive my brother.

174
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:08,156
We believe you.

175
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,164
Talk is cheap.

176
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,167
Perhaps a test of thy faith.

177
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,827
Walk through the wall.

178
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:14,097
I will remove it...

179
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:15,331
for you...

180
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,531
...later.

181
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:18,736
What do you want?

182
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,367
I got a job for thee.

183
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:22,503
Bring forth all the cookies
from your kitchen...

184
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,570
and leave them
on the Simpsons' porch.

185
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,639
But those belong
to our parents.

186
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:30,585
Look, do you want a happy God
or a vengeful God?

187
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:31,450
Happy God.

188
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:33,956
Then quit flapping your lip.

189
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:34,991
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:43,895
Whoops.

191
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,866
Help! Help!

192
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:50,737
Sounds like
trouble a-brewing at the old well!

193
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:52,298
Help me, please.

194
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:53,866
I fell down the well!

195
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:55,434
I'll get help, laddie.

196
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,537
A little nip of courage.

197
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:06,717
Out of my way!

198
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,883
Look out, you horse's arse!

199
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,189
Sucker.

200
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,494
Huh?

201
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:14,724
Hey, what's up?

202
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:16,060
Some poor kid...

203
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,259
fell down a well.

204
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,301
Yes!

205
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,462
My name is Timmy O'Toole.

206
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,508
I just turned ten years old.

207
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,567
Timmy, where are your parents?

208
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,339
I have no family.

209
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,142
I tried to enroll in school...

210
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,479
but Principal Skinner
turned me away...

211
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,381
because of my shabby clothes.

212
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:36,851
He's a liar.

213
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,323
The circumference
of the well is 34 inches.

214
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,483
So, unfortunately...

215
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,925
not one member
of our police force...

216
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,190
is slender enough
to rescue the boy.

217
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:50,233
By God, men,
you're a bunch of marshmallows.

218
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,767
Why don't you go, Chief?

219
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:52,859
Well, I'm too...

220
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:53,994
...important.

221
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,265
Timmy has told us...

222
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,705
his foot is trapped
under a rock.

223
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:01,733
Any attempt to pull him up
would snap him like a twig.

224
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:04,610
In desperation,
the city is considering...

225
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,615
more unorthodox solutions.

226
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:09,208
Grasping the child
firmly in his talons...

227
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:11,720
Socrates here will
fly him to safety.

228
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:13,050
Just watch.

229
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,756
I don't think
he's coming back.

230
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:23,925
With this hook
and this hunk of chocolate...

231
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,366
I'll land your boy...

232
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,630
and I'll clean him for free.

233
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:29,695
Although we can't reach the boy...

234
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,173
we can freeze him
with liquid nitrogen...

235
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,938
so that future generations
can rescue him.

236
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:39,108
Dear Lord, before we peel
the foil back from your bounty...

237
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:42,549
we ask you to watch over
little Timmy O'Toole...

238
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,177
trapped in that well.

239
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,681
Bart, what's wrong with you?

240
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,522
Yeah. Timmy is a real hero.

241
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:52,027
How do you mean, Dad?

242
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:55,758
Well, he fell down a well
and can't get out.

243
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,595
How does that
make him a hero?

244
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,431
Well, it's more than you did.

245
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,630
Channel 6's own Krusty the Clown...

246
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:04,367
has gathered members
of the entertainment community--

247
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:07,501
who normally steer clear
of fashionable causes--

248
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:08,703
for a video called...

249
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,270
''We're Sending Our Love
down the Well.''

250
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:12,781
I wanted to do something...

251
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:13,781
to help...

252
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,750
so I called my friend, Sting.

253
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:16,513
He said...

254
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,053
''When do you need me?''

255
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,486
I said, ''Thursday.''

256
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:20,989
He said, ''I'm busy.''

257
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:22,286
I said, ''Friday?''

258
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,621
He said...

259
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:24,854
''Friday's worse.''

260
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:27,362
<i>Then he said,
''How about Saturday?''</i>

261
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,058
I said, ''Fine.''

262
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,190
True story.

263
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,997
Yeah. I used to open
for Krusty in '69.

264
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,402
In fact, he fired me,
as I recall.

265
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:36,461
Oh, Sting.

266
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,770
But this isn't
about show business.

267
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,675
This is about some kid
down a hole...

268
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:43,076
or something.

269
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,704
We've gotta do what we can.

270
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:48,774
#There's a hole in my heart
as deep as a well #

271
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,788
# For that poor little boy
who sunk halfway to hell #

272
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,792
#Though we can't get him out
we'll do the next best thing #

273
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,957
#And go on TV
and sing, sing, sing #

274
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:06,765
#And we're sending our love
down the well #

275
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:09,135
#All the way down #

276
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:13,643
#We're sending our love
down the well #

277
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,575
# Down that well #

278
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:20,082
Krusty, what are your plans
for the royalties?

279
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,586
We got to pay for promotion,
shipping, distribution.

280
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,417
You know, those limos out back
aren't free.

281
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,050
Whatever's left,
we throw down the well.

282
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,063
Authentic Timmy O'Toole
baby teeth.

283
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:36,827
$6.00 a bag.

284
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,026
Step to the rear.

285
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:40,001
Plenty of room in the back.

286
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,440
<i>## The Itchy and Scratchy Show ##</i>

287
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:54,478
Hmm?

288
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,028
Hmm?

289
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,533
Ah.

290
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,869
Drop that microphone.

291
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,207
Drop it, boy!

292
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,475
This is a special report...

293
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,312
from Channel 6 News.

294
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:29,477
Disturbing news
from the old well...

295
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:30,747
where Timmy O'Toole...

296
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,551
has apparently taken
a turn for the worse.

297
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,651
It's very simple, Kent.

298
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:41,629
The child is reverting
to a feral or wolf-like state.

299
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,065
Here's an artist's conception.

300
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:47,131
Bart.

301
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:52,803
Ahem. I was trying
to gnaw my foot off, but...

302
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:55,836
I couldn't get through my sock.

303
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:57,504
Good night, everybody.

304
00:14:57,581 --> 00:15:00,015
The thought
of a boy trapped in a well...

305
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,847
brought out the kindness
of the entire community.

306
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:05,353
When they find out you've
been fooling them...

307
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:08,414
they're gonna want to cut
you up with rusty razors.

308
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,983
And how are they
going to find out?

309
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,995
The police will catch you.

310
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:15,190
The police couldn't
catch a cold.

311
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,597
Maybe not,
but you're stupid enough...

312
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,999
to have left
a ''Bart Simpson'' label...

313
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,537
on that radio.

314
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:28,505
D'oh!

315
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,170
''...and Cinderella had...

316
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:33,307
the most beautiful gown
at the ball...

317
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:35,874
with eight
satin petticoats...

318
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:38,978
each more delicate
than the last.''

319
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:40,317
I think he's asleep.

320
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,789
Want a cup of coffee?

321
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,790
Okay.

322
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,826
Brave little guy.

323
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:02,067
Hey. Almost tripped
over this thing.

324
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,724
Ugh!

325
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:16,467
What did I do
to deserve this?

326
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:17,732
<i>Help!</i>

327
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:19,740
<i>I fell down the well.</i>

328
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:22,072
Tell us something
we don't know.

329
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:26,178
<i>No, my name is Bart Simpson.</i>

330
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:28,409
<i>What are you doing
down there?</i>

331
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:30,417
Look, I'll level with you.

332
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:32,419
There is no Timmy O'Toole.

333
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:36,184
<i>It was just a prank
I was playing on everybody.</i>

334
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:38,522
Well, you sure
fooled us, kid.

335
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:40,652
Hey, I got an idea
for a prank.

336
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:41,821
<i>Let's go home...</i>

337
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:43,364
and go to sleep.

338
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,025
Good one, Eddie.

339
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:49,332
Ha, ha. Great joke, guys.

340
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:55,342
<i>Guys?</i>

341
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,570
<i>Your son...</i>

342
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:58,909
is trapped down the well.

343
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,177
You must think we're
the worst parents in the world.

344
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,242
Yes, that's pretty much
the feeling down at the station.

345
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,557
Don't worry, son.

346
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:11,387
Just 'cause you're trapped...

347
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,620
doesn't mean you can't live
a full life.

348
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:15,629
I brought you your Krusty doll.

349
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:16,664
Ow!

350
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,665
Knock it off, you bald boob!

351
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,394
Don't make me
come down there!

352
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:21,628
<i>Like to see you fit.</i>

353
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:22,635
Why, you little...!

354
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:24,968
- Put a man on him.

355
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,338
I like the other boy.

356
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:28,671
So polite.

357
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,439
What are you doing
to save my baby boy?

358
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:34,107
We've located
a piece of machinery...

359
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:35,376
in Louisiana...

360
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,918
that could pop him out
lickety-split.

361
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:40,011
Why don't you get it?

362
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:41,680
We've got a budget problem.

363
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:44,691
Your boy picked a bad time
to fall down a well.

364
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,853
<i>Had he done it at the start
of the fiscal year, no problemo.</i>

365
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:50,022
You're telling me
the city won't pay...

366
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:52,032
to get a boy out of a well?

367
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,194
They would have for Timmy,
but your son...

368
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,204
he played us all for saps.

369
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:58,705
Mmm.

370
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,708
We've all been the victims
of a cruel hoax...

371
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,040
perpetrated by
a ten-year-old hooligan.

372
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:06,103
The time has come
for finger-pointing...

373
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,046
and most of them
are squarely aimed...

374
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:09,378
at the boy's parents.

375
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:10,713
It's not our fault.

376
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,377
We didn't want the boy.

377
00:18:12,454 --> 00:18:13,716
He was an accident.

378
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:14,880
Homer!

379
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:17,049
Could you edit that last part?

380
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,251
Mr. Simpson, we're live.

381
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,418
D'oh!

382
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:22,054
# One plus one
plus three is five #

383
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,564
# Little Bart Simpson's
buried alive #

384
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:26,658
# He's so neat
He's so sweet #

385
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:29,260
# Now the rats
have Bart to eat... #

386
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:30,668
Hey, stop that!

387
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,673
Oh. Sorry, Lisa.

388
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:36,006
# How many days
until Bart croaks? #

389
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:38,045
# One, two, three, four... #

390
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:42,948
And our new number one hit
''I Do Believe We're Naked''

391
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:44,508
by Funky See, Funky Do...

392
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:47,521
replaces ''We're Sending Our Love
down the Well,''

393
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:50,456
which plunges
all the way down to number 97.

394
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,459
Ever since
I called for the rescue...

395
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:55,462
of that Simpson lad,
I have taken heat...

396
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,020
so I am flip-flopping.

397
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:59,692
I say let him stay down there.

398
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:07,540
Yeah, Shutton here.

399
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:09,543
Now, that's a story.

400
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:21,387
Bart, honey,
I made you an extra warm sweater...

401
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:24,789
you can wear
while you're down in the well.

402
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:25,951
Mom, it's too big.

403
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:27,654
You'll grow into it.

404
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:28,923
<i>Homer!</i>

405
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:31,898
I've done a lot of bad stuff
through the years.

406
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,900
Now I'm paying the price...

407
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:37,904
but there's so many things
I'll never get a chance to do--

408
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:39,234
smoke a cigarette...

409
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,399
use a fake I.D....

410
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,967
shave a swear word in my hair--

411
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:49,074
That's all I can stands.

412
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,708
I can't stands no more.

413
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:52,844
I'm going to get you
out of there myself.

414
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:04,560
Now, why didn't I think of that?

415
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:09,095
Agnes, we've got work to do.

416
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:21,782
This is Kent Brockman
with a special bulletin.

417
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,182
The Lincoln squirrel
has been assassinated.

418
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:27,278
We'll stay with the story
all night, if we have to.

419
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:31,390
What's going on?

420
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,223
It's an old-fashioned
hole digging.

421
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:36,593
By gar, it's been a while.

422
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:50,374
The canary.

423
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:51,605
Gas!

424
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,078
Out of the hole!

425
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:58,584
Gentlemen, this canary
died of natural causes.

426
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:00,416
Back in the hole!

427
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:05,758
Sting, you look tired.

428
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:08,091
Maybe you should take a rest.

429
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:10,563
Not while one
of my fans needs me.

430
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:13,897
Actually, I don't know if I've ever
heard Bart play your albums.

431
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,732
Shh! Marge,
he's a good digger.

432
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:20,436
Uhh!

433
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,442
Sting!

434
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,442
Mom!

435
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:24,876
Dad!

436
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:27,380
Bart, I've missed you so much.

437
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,518
Man, I was so scared.

438
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:32,052
Don't worry, son.

439
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,213
They're going to make sure...

440
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:37,281
no one ever falls down
this well again.

441
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:43,130
That should do it.

442
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:55,129
Shh!
