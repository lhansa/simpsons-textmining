00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:07,076
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:09,773
Before last year's
Halloween show...

3
00:00:09,848 --> 00:00:12,578
I warned you not to let
your children watch...

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,584
but you did anyway.

5
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:16,745
Well, this year's episode
is even worse.

6
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:18,755
It's scarier, more violent...

7
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:21,917
and I think they snuck in
some bad language too.

8
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:25,929
So please, tuck in
your children and--

9
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:29,398
Well, if you didn't listen
to me last time...

10
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,458
you're not going to now.

11
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:33,470
Enjoy the show.

12
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:59,194
...to conclude this Halloween
newscast on a scary note:

13
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:02,358
remember,
the presidential primaries...

14
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:04,867
are only a few months away.

15
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:07,632
Hey, if you don't like it,
go to Russia.

16
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,700
Trick or treat, man.

17
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,471
Aren't you a little old
for this?

18
00:01:13,545 --> 00:01:14,807
You're not even
wearing costumes.

19
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,315
Hand over the candy, old dude,
or we egg your house.

20
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:20,317
Here you go, kids.

21
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:21,909
Heh-heh... heh.

22
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:23,954
Lousy punks.

23
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:25,489
- D'oh!

24
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:29,783
We're home.

25
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:33,925
Aah... whoo!

26
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:35,932
Get a good haul this year?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,989
Jackpot!

28
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:39,662
I'm very, very proud
of you kids.

29
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:42,137
We would have gotten more
if Lisa walked faster.

30
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:44,141
I didn't select this
costume for mobility.

31
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:48,236
I wore it to salute
the noble Native Americans
of the Pacific Northwest.

32
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:49,507
Yaahh!

33
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:51,071
Ha-ha-ha!

34
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,016
Children, you can have
one piece of candy tonight...

35
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:56,019
and save the rest for--

36
00:01:58,022 --> 00:02:00,786
If you eat too much,
you'll have nightmares.

37
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,792
Oh, yeah,
everybody in this family...

38
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,794
will have
a bad nightmare tonight.

39
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:06,955
Oh, yeah,
three bad nightmares.

40
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:09,693
I'd like to see that.
Heh-heh-heh.

41
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:17,364
Ooh.

42
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:30,180
What a dump! Why would
Princess Grace live here?

43
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:32,155
- Dad, that's Monaco.
- D'oh!

44
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,956
I can do that,
but I don't want to.

45
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:40,956
Ugh! What is this thing?

46
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:45,298
It is a monkey's paw, dating
back to Al-Al Ben Abdallah.

47
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,838
It grants wishes
to its owner.

48
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:49,566
Oh, yeah? How much?

49
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:52,166
I strongly advise you,
do not purchase this.

50
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:54,734
<i>Behind every wish
lurks grave misfortune.</i>

51
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:56,837
I was once president of Algeria.

52
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:59,644
I don't want to hear
your life story. Paw me.

53
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:05,152
Eww, Homer. Where did you
get that ugly thing?

54
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:08,386
Why, at that little shop
right over... there.

55
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:11,957
Oh, it was over there.

56
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,588
You'll be sorry.

57
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:16,896
<i>Flight 7, Marrakesh
to Springfield, now boarding.</i>

58
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,799
Just a moment.

59
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,205
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

60
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:26,470
They're souvenirs.

61
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:29,172
You must pay a fine
of two American dollars.

62
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:30,271
Okay.

63
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:33,181
Let's wish for X-ray specs
that really work.

64
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,684
No, Bart-- peace on Earth.

65
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:35,684
- X-ray specs.
- Peace on Earth.

66
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:36,811
- Peace on Earth.
- X-ray specs.

67
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:37,980
- X-ray specs.
- Peace on Earth.

68
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:40,149
As the pants-wearer
of this house...

69
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,589
I get the first wish.

70
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,923
Homer, there's something
I don't like...

71
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:45,963
about that severed hand.

72
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,055
Marge, don't flake out on me.

73
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:51,033
That monkey's paw is going
to make our dreams come true.

74
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:56,540
<i>- Oh, no! Maggie made a wish.</i>

75
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,770
Oh, my land!

76
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:01,175
<i>Ooh.! A luxury car.</i>

77
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:04,214
<i>- Good baby. Good Maggie.</i>

78
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:09,017
<i>Ohh, a new pacifier.</i>

79
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:10,349
D'oh!

80
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:13,322
No more fooling around.
Paw, this is Bart.

81
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,621
I wish for Simpsons
to be rich and famous.

82
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,024
Now you're talking.

83
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:20,888
- Yay!
- Yay!

84
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:22,728
Wahoo!

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,564
Look, everybody.
My purse exploded!

86
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:26,864
Come on, everybody.

87
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:30,101
We're going to the fanciest
restaurant in town.

88
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:31,835
I'm terrible sorry.

89
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:34,503
I have absolutely nothing
untilJune.

90
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:38,276
Ah, the Simpsons!
Right this way, please.

91
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,149
Homer, maybe fame and fortune
aren't as bad as they say.

92
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,814
If I hear one more thing
about the Simpsons...

93
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,322
I swear I'll scream.

94
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,326
At first they were cute,
but now they're annoying.

95
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,328
1 8 bucks for this?

96
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:53,728
What a rip-off.

97
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:01,501
Man, this thing's
really getting out of hand.

98
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:06,138
Is there anything they won't do?

99
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,644
Oh, Homer, this is awful.

100
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:10,977
The guy that
sold me this thing...

101
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,448
did say the wishes
would bring grave misfortune.

102
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:15,543
I thought he was being colorful.

103
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,713
I wish for world peace.

104
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:21,416
Lisa, that was
very selfish of you!

105
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:27,460
Sorry about the Falklands.

106
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:30,399
Oh, forget it.
We knew they were yours.

107
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,473
Well, won't be needing
these anymore.

108
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:55,020
<i># Come on, people now,
smile on your brother #</i>

109
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:56,525
<i># Everybody get together #</i>

110
00:05:56,594 --> 00:06:01,361
<i># Try to love one another
right now ##</i>

111
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:03,263
Foolish humans.

112
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,767
Oh, yes, Kodos.

113
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:07,361
Earth is now ripe
for the plucking.

114
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,656
People of Earth, we come to you in
the spirit of hostility and menace.

115
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:33,663
Now, we can resolve our
differences peacefully.

116
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:34,959
Uh... ow!

117
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:38,729
Your superior intellect is
no match for our puny weapons.

118
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:39,963
Gordon, do something.

119
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,835
What do you want me to do?
I'm a baker now.

120
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:44,238
Conquered with a club.

121
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:45,798
Wish we'd saved an A-bomb.

122
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:47,139
Move along humans.

123
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,480
This is all the Simpsons' fault.

124
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:52,482
Before I was just
bored with them...

125
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,518
now I wish they were dead.

126
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:56,985
Geez, now we're slaves.
This paw sucks.

127
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,488
Okay, I'll make a wish
that can't backfire.

128
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:02,424
I wish for a turkey sandwich,
on rye bread...

129
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,085
<i>with lettuce and mustard...</i>

130
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:07,096
<i>and... and I don't want
any zombie turkeys.</i>

131
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,598
I don't want to turn
into a turkey myself...

132
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,932
and I don't want any other
weird surprises, you got it?

133
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:16,771
Hey!

134
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:19,105
Hmm... mmm!

135
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,734
Mmm... not bad.

136
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:22,802
<i>Nice hot mustard,
good bread...</i>

137
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,609
turkey's a little dry--

138
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:26,809
The turkey's a little dry?!

139
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,943
Oh, foul the cursed thing!

140
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,480
What demon from the depths
of hell created thee?

141
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:36,459
Hey, is that one of
those monkey paw dealies...

142
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,620
that lets you wish for things?

143
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:41,790
Yeah, but I got to warn
you that this thing is--

144
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:45,097
Yeah, that's what it is.
You want to try it?

145
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,158
Okely-dokely.

146
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:49,138
Ooh, would you look at that.

147
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,468
Aahh!

148
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,476
Kneel before my slingshot,
puny earthling!

149
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:55,307
Well, I guess my first wish...

150
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,643
is to get rid
of those awful aliens.

151
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:00,149
Aahh! He's got a board
with a nail in it!

152
00:08:00,217 --> 00:08:01,946
Enslave humanity, will ya?!

153
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,953
Run, Kodos!

154
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,052
Ha-ha-ha!

155
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:10,423
Well, Kang, it seems
the earthlings won.

156
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,052
Did they?

157
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,654
That board with the nail in it
may have defeated us...

158
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:16,700
but the humans won't stop there.

159
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,099
They'll make bigger boards
and bigger nails.

160
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,037
Soon they will make
a board with a nail so big...

161
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:24,040
it will destroy them all!

162
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:35,549
Hey, Homer...

163
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,520
this thingumajig works great.

164
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:39,613
Now that I've saved the Earth...

165
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,490
maybe I ought to spruce up
the old homestead.

166
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:45,961
I wish I had a monkey's paw.

167
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,351
Bart?

168
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:52,685
Bart?

169
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:54,350
Huh? What's the matter?

170
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:57,020
I had a bad dream.
Could I sleep in your bed?

171
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:58,586
No.

172
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,928
I'll give you a candy necklace.

173
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,365
Climb aboard.

174
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:10,473
- Thanks, Bart.
- Less talk, more sleep.

00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,290
<i>because this particular monster

<i>And did I mention

[ Nervous Laughing ]

193

Every day, same old cat.
I'll make him more interesting.

194
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:21,011
Much better. Oh, good,

195

It's good that you made
that awful thing, Bart.

- Okay.

It's the air conditioning.

Then I realized his spirit was

00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:10,617
Hi, there.

350
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:12,253
I'm your daddy.

351
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,467
[ Homer's Voice ]
Mmm!

352
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:31,973
Mmm! Sprin-kles.

353
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,312
Geraldo Rivera...

354
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,785
Madonna, and a diseased yak.

355
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:37,549
<i>[ Lisa ]
Mom, what's wrong?</i>

356
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:39,317
It's your father-- he's missing.

357
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,222
Dad's missing?
Get out of here.

358
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,089
He's been gone for two days.

359
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,186
What do you know?
She's right.

360
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:50,167
It wasn't supposed
to be this way.

361
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:53,068
It was supposed to be
a thing of beauty...

362
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:55,072
not this abomination.

363
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,234
Oh, Smithers,
I was wrong to play God.

364
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:03,405
Life is precious,
not a thing to be toyed with.

365
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,972
Take out that brain
and flush it down the toilet.

366
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:07,746
His family might appreciate it...

367
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,810
if you returned the brain
to his body.

368
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:13,824
Come on. It's 1 1 :45!

369
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:17,658
Oh, Smithers, when you look at
me with those puppy-dog eyes--

370
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,128
All right.

371
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,132
Ow. Ow.

372
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:25,965
- Ow. Ow.
- Quit your complaining.

373
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,631
<i>Do you know what
this means? He is alive.</i>

374
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,640
Ooh, you're right, Smithers.

375
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,471
I guess I owe you a Coke.

376
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:35,672
And as for you, you clinking,
clattering cacophony...

377
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:38,773
<i>of collagenous cogs
and camshafts, take... that.!</i>

378
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,952
Aahh!

379
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:45,319
- Run, sir.

380
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,085
Every bone... shattered...

381
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,095
organs... leaking vital fluids...

382
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:55,064
a slight headache,
loss of appetite.

383
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:58,864
Smithers, I'm going to die.

384
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:01,929
- Is there nothing I can do?
- Well, perhaps.

385
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:03,940
Smithers, go to my office.

386
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:07,102
In the third drawer
of my desk are...

387
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,476
surgical tools
and some ether.

388
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:12,107
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh!

389
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,775
Did you have a nightmare?

390
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:16,343
- No. Bart bit me.
- You were crushing me.

391
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,151
I tried to scream, but
my mouth was full of flab.

392
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:21,351
Got to shake the dew
off the lily.

393
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:26,462
- Aahh!
- Perhaps you're wondering
why you have two heads.

394
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:29,989
My body was crushed, so
I had head grafted onto your...

395
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:32,161
shall we say, ample frame.

396
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:35,604
I can wake up.
It's all a dream. It's just a dream.

397
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:37,607
Oh, that's right.

398
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:39,700
It's all a dream...

399
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:41,642
<i>or is it?</i>

400
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,617
<i>Next week on The Simpsons:</i>

401
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:51,951
Don't forget, Dad.
Tonight my class is having...

402
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:54,116
an all-you-can-eat
spaghetti dinner.

403
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:55,250
Mmm. Spaghetti.

404
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:57,089
But, Homer,
tonight's our reception...

405
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:59,392
for Queen Beatrix
of the Netherlands.

406
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,637
Oh, I hate having two heads.
