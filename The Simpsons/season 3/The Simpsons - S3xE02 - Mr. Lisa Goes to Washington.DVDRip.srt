- Congressman...

326
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:10,546
you're under arrest.

327
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:17,146
- You work fast.
- I work for Uncle Sam.

328
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,621
We will now vote
on the House bill 1 022--

329
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:25,525
the expulsion of Bob Arnold.

330
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:29,555
<i>Mr. Speaker, I'm all for the bill,</i>
<i>but shouldn't we tack on...</i>

331
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,397
- a pay raise for ourselves?
- <i>[ All ] No.!</i>

332
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:39,167
Okay, this should make
my bosses very happy.

333
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:44,408
- Your bosses?
- Yep. All 250 million of them.

334
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:49,976
When my family arrived
in this country four months ago...

335
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:52,887
we spoke no English
and had no money in our pockets.

336
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:57,086
Today, we own a nationwide chain
of wheel-balancing centers.

337
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,392
Where else but in America--
or possibly Canada--

338
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:03,365
could our family find
such opportunity?

339
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:06,096
That's why whenever I see
the stars and stripes...

340
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,197
I'll always be reminded
of that wonderful word ''flag.''

341
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,208
[ Cheering, Applause ]

342
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,541
There will be a brief recess
while the judges tabulate their votes.

343
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:18,206
<i>Lisa, what's</i>
<i>gotten into you?</i>

344
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:21,046
Yeah, your other speech
was a little more crowd pleasing.

345
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:25,885
I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't think of a nice way
to say America stinks.

346
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:29,016
Extra! Extra!
Feds nab rotten rep.

347
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,027
Give me one of those.

348
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:35,191
<i>''Imprisoned congressman</i>
<i>becomes born</i>-<i>again Christian. ''</i>

349
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:39,031
I can't believe it.
The system works.

350
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:48,343
- He already sang this song.
- No, that was about the budget gap.

351
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,039
- This is the trading gap.
- <i>[ Applause ]</i>

352
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,882
And now
the moment of truth.

353
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:58,684
Will the winning essay be
'' Bubble on, O melting pot''?

354
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,657
<i>''Lift high your lamp,</i>
<i>Green Lady''?</i>

355
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:04,558
<i>''USA, A</i>-<i>OK''?</i>

356
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:07,256
<i>Or ''Cesspool on the Potomac''?</i>

357
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:10,300
Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool!
Cesspool! Cesspool!

358
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,801
And now the winner is...

359
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,101
'' USA, A-OK,''
by Trong Van Dinh.

360
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:18,403
D'oh!

361
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:24,239
Miss Crowley, thank you
for this oversized novelty check.

362
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:27,841
I would like share this honor
with all of my fellow essayists...

363
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:30,887
particularly
the courageous Lisa Simpson...

364
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:33,149
whose inflammatory
rhetoric reminded us...

365
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:36,715
<i>that the price of freedom</i>
<i>is eternal vigilance.</i>

366
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:39,888
- Give her the check!
- [ All Laughing ]

367
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:41,954
I was serious.

368
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:57,913
- <i>Ow.!</i>
- Bart!

369
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:01,439
Lis, you taught me to stand up
for what I believe in.

370
00:22:50,712 --> 00:22:52,646
Shh!
