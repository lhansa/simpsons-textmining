1
00:00:02,593 --> 00:00:07,860
<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:38,985
D'oh!

3
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:58,628
I hold in my hand
the final ax.

4
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,328
Ah, heh...

5
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:11,808
That's all the time
we have for today.

6
00:01:11,877 --> 00:01:13,902
I'd like to thank Sideshow Mel...

7
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,413
Corporal Punishment,
Tina Ballerina...

8
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:19,246
<i>and from Knots Landing,
Miss Donna Mills.</i>

9
00:01:19,318 --> 00:01:20,751
Oh, she was a sport.

10
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:38,599
See you some other time!

11
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,933
Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk!

12
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:44,269
Great show, Krusty.

13
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:46,072
I really laughed when--

14
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:55,549
You've got
a merchandising meeting.

15
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,883
- Cancel it!
- Therapist?

16
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,047
Cancel it!

17
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:00,057
The line on the Giants
is 5½/.

18
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,387
Put a dime on it.

19
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,894
''Thank you'' dinner
with Bart Simpson?

20
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:05,725
I don't know Bart Simpson.

21
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:07,891
The boy
who saved you from jail.

22
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:12,062
Well, we made a terrible,
terrible mistake.

23
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:13,126
Ah...

24
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,763
won't happen again.

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,138
There was one boy
who trusted me...

26
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,141
all along.

27
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,734
- Bart?
- Yes, sir?

28
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:20,801
Thank you.

29
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,370
Oh, yeah.

30
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:25,212
Cancel it!

31
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:31,618
Hello?

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,850
Mrs. Simpson?

33
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,985
Lois Pennycandy,
Krusty the Clown's assistant.

34
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,426
Hello, Mrs. Pennycandy.

35
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:39,930
<i>It's Miss Pennycandy,
I can assure you.</i>

36
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:41,431
I'm sorry to inform you...

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,333
that Krusty will not
be joining Bart for dinner.

38
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:46,871
This is the fifth time
he's cancelled.

39
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,635
How can he hurt someone
who loves him so?

40
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,039
Oh, Mrs. Simpson...

41
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,910
I've wasted my womanhood
asking that same question.

42
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,379
I apologize for him.

43
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:58,916
Something really important
came up.

44
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:00,884
Lousy mildew!

45
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:04,812
That's good enough.

46
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,256
Well, thank you for calling.

47
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:08,258
Good-bye.

48
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:12,291
How many Krusty autographs
do you want?

49
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:13,456
A hundred.

50
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:14,157
Done.

51
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,310
Sweetie, I'm sorry...

52
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,372
but Krusty isn't coming
to dinner again.

53
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,974
Oh, man.

54
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:38,688
<i>''Dear Krusty,
this is Bart Simpson...</i>

55
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:41,123
<i>''Krusty buddy number 1 6302</i>

56
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:45,152
<i>''respectfully returning

57
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,495

00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,899
<i>''Now I know for sure.</i>

59
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,837
<i>Get bent. Bart Simpson. ''</i>

60
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,932
Ooh, SEX-CHAT!

61
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:01,978
You've reached the party line.

62
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,242
You'll be connected
to a hot party...

63
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,807
with the world's
most beautiful women.

64
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:08,546
Now let's join the party.

65
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,552
Hello?

66
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:10,553
Hello?

67
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:11,554
Hello?

68
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:13,215
Are there
any women here?

69
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:14,224
Hello?!

70
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,555
Are you beautiful?

71
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:17,060
Do I sound beautiful?!

72
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,394
This is not as hot
as I had anticipated.

73
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:21,796
Read this!

74
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,732
Uh-- I, um--

75
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:26,032
Uh-- Uh--

76
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:28,299
''Dee--'' Uh--

77
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:29,397
''Deee--''

78
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:30,406
''Dear...

79
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:31,908
''Krus-s-s-t--

80
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:32,909
Why--?''

81
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,468
It says the little boy...

82
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:38,004
who never lost faith in you
has lost faith in you.

83
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,779
You will go to Bart Simpson's
for dinner!

84
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:41,820
But I have plans.

85
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:42,945
Hey! Not the face!

86
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,581
Why you maddening,
impossible man!

87
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:47,420
If you don't go tonight...

88
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:49,255
I won't be here tomorrow.

89
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,193
Oh, all right, I'll go.

90
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,560
Oh, Krusty!

91
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:55,828
But I hate missing schnapps night
at the Friars Club.

92
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,028
Bart, wipe your feet.

93
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,536
Why bother?

94
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:01,573
They'll just
get dirty again.

95
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,868
I've got good news.

96
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:05,239
Krusty is coming
to dinner tonight.

97
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,538
He is? For sure?

98
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:07,544
Yes.

99
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,672
God bless that clown.

100
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:14,085
<i>Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk!</i>

101
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:15,915
You think it's him?

102
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:23,725
Cute kid.

103
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:27,262
Oh, hi, Bart.

104
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:29,596
I was just in
the neighborhood--

105
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,863
What? Krusty the Clown!

106
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:33,268
What a surprise!

107
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:36,739
Milhouse, you can come in,
and drop the charade.

108
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:38,605
<i>Whoa!</i>

109
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:41,237
<i>You don't have
to be on tonight.</i>

110
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:42,803
What are you
talking about?

111
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,007
Of course he does.

112
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,606
No. Krusty is our guest.

113
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:47,948
Your pratfalls
and punchinello antics...

114
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,453
aren't necessary here.

115
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:50,613
Really?

116
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,520
Yeah.Just relax
and be yourself.

117
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:54,218
Oh, that's a relief.

118
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:58,854
Go wait in the car.

119
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,666
Aw! We could have seen
a monkey.

120
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:05,703
Who wants to say grace?

121
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:07,329
Let's let our guest do it.

122
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,237
Bless us, O Lord--

123
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,400
Hey!

124
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,942
Krusty, do the honors.

125
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,568
Well, all right.

126
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:16,910
I'm a little rusty,
but, um... I'll try.

127
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:19,109
<i>Baruch ata Adonai...</i>

128
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:20,947
<i>Eloheinu melech
ha-olam...</i>

129
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,419
<i>ha-motzi lechem
min ha-aretz.</i>

130
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:26,081
He's talking funny talk.

131
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:28,092
No, Dad,
that's Hebrew.

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,128
Krusty must beJewish.

133
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:31,753
AJewish entertainer?

134
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,092
Get out of here!

135
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:36,032
There are many prominent
Jewish entertainers...

136
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:39,662
including Lauren Bacall,
Dinah Shore, William Shatner...

137
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:40,705
and Mel Brooks.

138
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:42,262
Mel Brooks is Jewish?!

139
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,038
Krusty, are you all right?

140
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:49,603
<i>Yes, it's just that saying
the Brucha brings back...</i>

141
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,546
a lot of
painful memories.

142
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,208
The old days...

143
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,912
my-my father.

144
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:57,012
Hey, Krusty, you
going to finish...

145
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,750
that meat loaf,
or what?

146
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:08,192
Poor Krusty.

147
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:11,235
He's like a velvet painting
come to life.

148
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:14,363
Krusty, why don't you
tell us what's wrong?

149
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,428
Spill your guts.

150
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:16,439
Yeah. Come on.

151
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:17,532
Krusty, tell us.

152
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:18,598
Well, okay.

153
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:19,701
First of all...

154
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:22,246
my real name isn't
Krusty the Clown.

155
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:24,544
It's Herschel Krustofski.

156
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:26,140
My father was a rabbi.

157
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:27,878
His father was a rabbi.

158
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:29,443
His father's father--

159
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:31,148
Well, you get the idea.

160
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,816
<i>My father was
the most respected man...</i>

161
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:36,622
<i>in the Lower East Side
of Springfield.</i>

162
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,993
<i>People would come
from miles around...</i>

163
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:40,292
<i>to ask his advice.</i>

164
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:42,959
Reb Krustofski,
should I finish college?

165
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:46,299
Yes. No one is poor except
he who lacks knowledge.

166
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,635
Rabbi, should I have
another child?

167
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:51,642
Yes. Another child
would be a blessing.

168
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,974
Rabbi, should I
buy a Chrysler?

169
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:57,811
Could you rephrase that
as an ethical question?

170
00:07:57,882 --> 00:08:00,407
<i>Um... is it right
to buy a Chrysler?</i>

171
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:03,648
Yes-- for great is the car
with power steering...

172
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:05,485
and Dyna-Flo suspension.

173
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:06,649
Papa?

174
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,159
When I grow up,
can I be a clown?

175
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,718
No! A clown is not respected.

176
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:13,229
I'll make people laugh.

177
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:14,959
Herschel, life is serious.

178
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:17,695
Seltzer is for drinking,
not for spraying.

179
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:20,101
Pie is for noshing,
not for throwing.

180
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:21,103
But, Papa--

181
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:22,104
But nothing!

182
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:23,470
You'll do as I say...

183
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,600
<i>or you'll get
such a zetz...</i>

184
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:28,441
that you won't even know
what hit you.

185
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:31,380
<i>Dad wanted me to follow
in his footsteps...</i>

186
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,077
<i>but the pull of clowning
was too strong.</i>

187
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:37,383
<i>I got my first laughs
at yeshiva...</i>

188
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,116
<i>impersonating my father.</i>

189
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,714
Blah, blah, blah... Moses!

190
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:49,631
<i>Boy, you don't have to follow
in my footsteps.</i>

191
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,963
Don't worry.

192
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:53,971
I don't even like using
the bathroom after you.

193
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,529
Why, you little--

194
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,074
Krusty, please continue.

195
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:58,439
Okay.

196
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,343
<i>My father tried to extinguish
the comedy bug...</i>

197
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:02,641
<i>but it was no use.</i>

198
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,375
What are you doing?

199
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:05,381
<i>Go away.</i>

200
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,610
Open the door!

201
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,414
<i>Oy, gevalt!</i>

202
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:10,920
Close the door!

203
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:14,550
<i>Then came my big break.</i>

204
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:17,254
<i>A Talmudic conference
in the Catskills.</i>

205
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:19,057
<i>I was the entertainment.</i>

206
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,496
<i>But the lord works
in mysterious ways.</i>

207
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:24,966
My son, Herschel...

208
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,504
was first
in his yeshiva class.

209
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:28,630
He was voted...

210
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:30,368
most likely
to hear God.

211
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:33,002
Go on, Hyman, you're
exaggerating again.

212
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:34,739
A rabbi never exaggerates.

213
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:37,145
A rabbi composes,
he creates thoughts...

214
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:40,082
he tells stories that
may never have happened...

215
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:41,880
but he does not exaggerate.

216
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:45,150
<i>My father would have
never suspected a thing...</i>

217
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:47,555
<i>were it not for
one rowdy rabbi.</i>

218
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,887
Hey, funny man!

219
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,655
No, no, no!

220
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:54,463
Herschel?

221
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,467
<i>Herschel,
oy vey iz mir!</i>

222
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,969
You have brought shame
on our family.

223
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,598
If you were a musician
or a jazz singer...

224
00:10:02,674 --> 00:10:04,699
this I could forgive,
but this?

225
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,368
I never want...

226
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:08,708
to see you again,
you--you clown!

227
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:15,878
I haven't seen
my father since.

228
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:17,649
That is so sad.

229
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,384
Do you think about
your father a lot?

230
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,425
All the time.

231
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,586
Except when
I'm at the track.

232
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,563
Oh, look!

233
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,331
Aww... hmm.

234
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:35,702
Oh, look at you, Bart.

235
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:38,072
Oh, isn't that fun!

236
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:40,441
Ooh, hey! Whoa!

237
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:42,707
Oh, Fourth ofJuly.

238
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:46,182
I can't believe
that little boy is you, Bart.

239
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:49,186
Yeah. I got a lot
of fond memories.

240
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:50,846
Look at the time.

241
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:52,514
Almost midnight.

242
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,888
Do you have any yearbooks?

243
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,449
You've seen everything.

244
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:59,520
Milhouse, know any
''knock, knock''jokes?

245
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:02,293
I want to go home.

246
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:05,461
Homer, maybe you better
take Milhouse home.

247
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:06,526
Gladly.

248
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:13,403
Wow! The Concert for Bangladesh.

249
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:17,071
Good night, Krusty.

250
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:18,547
Sorry about your dad.

251
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:21,176
Don't worry about me.
I'm a survivor.

252
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:23,015
Did I leave my keys?

253
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:23,917
No!

254
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:25,216
Oh, here they are.

255
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,552
Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk!

256
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:28,216
Ehh...

257
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:40,668
Hmm... ah... uh... ohh!

258
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,780
<i>Academy Award Playhouse...</i>

259
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:54,307
<i>now returns you to
Hercules Versus the Martians.</i>

260
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,185
<i>Welcome to our spaceship,
mighty Hercules. Heh-heh.</i>

261
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:04,823
Hello? Hello?!

262
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:06,659
Anybody there?

263
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:08,028
I hear a phone ring...

264
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:10,659
I'm listening,
and there's no talking.

265
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:12,134
Why would they call...

266
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:14,194
if they don't want
to talk?

267
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,611
Huh?

268
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:28,777
Hee-hee-hee!

269
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:29,717
Aahh!
Aahh!

270
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:42,658
Didn't ItchyJunior look happy
playing with his father?

271
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:46,670
And didn't ScratchyJunior
look happy playing with his dad...

272
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:49,332
until they got run over
by the thresher?

273
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:51,841
Wasn't that a beautiful cartoon?

274
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:56,213
For the love of God,
cut to the commercial!

275
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:57,441
Poor Krusty!

276
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,676
A man who envies
our family...

277
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:01,514
is a man
who needs help.

278
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:03,349
We've got
to do something.

279
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:04,513
Let's move.

280
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,914
Reverend Lovejoy...

281
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,357
we need you to help us
find a rabbi.

282
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,952
Well, before you make
any rash decisions...

283
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,760
let me remind you
that the church is changing...

284
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:17,130
to meet the needs
of young Christians.

285
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:18,668
We're not converting.

286
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:21,500
We just want to find
a Rabbi Krustofski.

287
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:23,699
I do a radio
call-in show with him...

288
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,333
every Sunday night.

289
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,310
- Really?
- I didn't know that.

290
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:30,506
I mention it
in my sermon every week.

291
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:32,549
<i>Oh, that radio show.</i>

292
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:36,485
It's all the kids talk about
on Monday at school.

293
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:39,148
Well, why don't you have
a free T-shirt?

294
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:42,351
You'll be the coolest kids
in the playground.

295
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:43,951
We'll put them on later.

296
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:46,326
Can you give us
the rabbi's address?

297
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:47,489
Oh, sure thing.

298
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,999
Let me check my
non-Christian Rolodex.

299
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:51,535
I bet he misses Krusty.

300
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:54,833
He'll be so happy,
he'll cry in his beard.

301
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:57,840
Oh, yes, yes.

302
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,843
Rabbi Krustofski?

303
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:02,345
What can I do for you,
my young friend?

304
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:04,506
We came to talk
about your son.

305
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,675
I have no son!

306
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:10,050
Great, we came all this way,
and it's the wrong guy.

307
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:13,100
I didn't mean that
literally!

308
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:20,531
And in order to keep our
broadcasting license...

309
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:22,075
we devote
Sunday night dead time...

310
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:24,474
to public service shows
of limited appeal.

311
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:27,446
<i>In that spirit, we bring you
Gabbin'About God...</i>

312
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:30,609
sponsored by Ace Religious Supply,
where they say...

313
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:32,948
''If we don't got it,
it ain't holy.''

314
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,114
With us once again,
our very own three wise men--

315
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,455
Reverend Timothy Lovejoy,
Monsignor Kenneth Daly...

316
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,392
and Rabbi
Hyman Krustofski.

317
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:44,295
Our first caller
is from Shelbyville Heights.

318
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:46,799
With all the suffering
in the world...

319
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:49,495
do you ever wonder
if God really exists?

320
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,195
No.

321
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:50,965
Not for a second.

322
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:51,766
Not at all.

323
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,534
Good conversation there.

324
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:56,041
Our next call now is
for the good rabbi.

325
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,042
Hello?

326
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,970
I hear breathing,
but I don't hear talking.

327
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:02,982
What's going on?
Hello? Mister?

328
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:08,151
Some people got nothing to do
but call and hang up.

329
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:10,315
<i>There's all kinds of mishagoyim.</i>

330
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:12,586
Our next caller is
a Springfield boy.

331
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,560
My name is Dmitri.

332
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:17,529
I'm a first-time caller,
long-time listener.

333
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:21,056
If a son defies his father
and chooses a career...

334
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,865
that makes millions
of children happy...

335
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:25,997
shouldn't the father
forgive the son?

336
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:27,005
I think so.

337
00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:28,006
Of course.

338
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,440
Absolutely not! Never!

339
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,273
Who screens these calls?

340
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:32,676
Who's in charge here?

341
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:35,613
They leave a building
without people watching it?

342
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:37,947
I got a plan that can't fail.

343
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:42,788
Yiddle, my man,
you're a genius.

344
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:44,653
I love my work.

345
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:49,560
Oh, the best charity is to give
and not let other people know.

346
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,963
But what if your example
encourages others to give?

347
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,796
Speaking of charity...

348
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:58,304
don't you think it's time
you forgave your son?

349
00:15:58,372 --> 00:15:59,964
My boy broke my heart!

350
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,474
He turned his back
on our traditions...

351
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,306
on our faith, and on me.

352
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:06,812
<i>Get out of here,
you little pisher.</i>

353
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,313
<i>Oy, this guy's tough.</i>

354
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:10,213
We'll have to outsmart him.

355
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:11,546
He's pretty sharp.

356
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,985
He saw right through
this disguise.

357
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,316
What? Saul Bellow?

358
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:17,983
The Nobel prize-winning
Jewish novelist?

359
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:20,151
He wants to have lunch with me?

360
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:21,194
It's a date.

361
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,286
Izzy's deli, 1 :00.
I'll be there.

362
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:24,763
The French government...

363
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:27,096
wants to give me
the Legion of Honor?

364
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,761
Where do I receive
this prestigious award?

365
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:30,929
Izzy's deli, 1 :00.

366
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:32,973
Thank you, Monsieur President.

367
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,405
<i>Au revoir.</i>

368
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:40,437
Are you kids ready
to order yet?

369
00:16:40,514 --> 00:16:43,950
Just get us another bowl
of complimentary pickles.

370
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:45,952
Watch how fast I go.

371
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,282
And for you, sir?

372
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:50,255
I want a nice sandwich,
but theJoey Bishop--

373
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:51,450
too fatty.

374
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,925
TheJackie Mason--
makes me gassy.

375
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:54,961
The Bruce Willis?

376
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:56,291
I don't like his work.

377
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:58,297
What is this--
a Krusty the Clown?

378
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:01,266
Ham, sausage and bacon,
with a smidge of mayo.

379
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:01,824
What?

380
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:02,834
On white.

381
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,962
You tell Mr. Saul Bellow...

382
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,803
the Nobel prize-winning
Jewish novelist...

383
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,672
that I lost my appetite.

384
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,141
Could you direct me to President
Francois Mitterand's table?

385
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:18,650
You think you're funny?

386
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,153
50 million Frenchmen
can't be wrong.

387
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,990
We've been going
about this all wrong.

388
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,586
What's the one thing rabbis
prize above everything else?

389
00:17:28,662 --> 00:17:30,254
Those stupid hats?

390
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,821
No, Bart-- knowledge.

391
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,834
<i>We'll hit him where it hurts--</i>

392
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:36,460
right in theJudaica.

393
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:45,440
''Glub, glub, glub.''

394
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:47,605
''Oh, Noah, Noah,
save us, save us!''

395
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:48,943
''No!''

396
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:51,280
This looks good, Bart.

397
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:52,943
Take it to him.

398
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,544
You I told to go away.

399
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:56,953
Does it not say
in the Babylonian Talmud...

400
00:17:57,024 --> 00:18:00,289
''a child should be pushed aside
with the left hand...

401
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,692
and drawn closer
with the right''?

402
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:03,889
Yes.

403
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:05,295
Your religion commands...

404
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:06,730
you make up with Krusty.

405
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,633
<i>But in Exodus,
the fifth commandment says...</i>

406
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:12,035
''Honor thy father
and thy mother.''

407
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,539
End of story.

408
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,004
Oh, it's hopeless.

409
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:17,441
Not quite.

410
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:21,538
I got some dynamite stuff
from Rabbi Simon Ben-Eliazar.

411
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:25,210
''At all times let a man
be supple as a reed...

412
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:27,753
and not rigid
as a cedar.''

413
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:31,587
<i>Bart, my short, learned friend,
the Book ofJoshua says...</i>

414
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:35,594
<i>''You shall meditate on the Torah
all day and all night.''</i>

415
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,727
Hmm.

416
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:45,264
<i>Is it not written
in the Talmud...</i>

417
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:47,273
''who will bring
redemption?

418
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,603
The jesters.''

419
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,165
I'm still not convinced...

420
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:52,439
and this is hardly
the time to discuss it.

421
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:55,938
Here you go, Bart.

422
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:58,951
It's a long shot,
but that's all I can do...

423
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:01,112
without learning
ancient Hebrew.

424
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:06,485
<i>Bart, I am not going
to learn ancient Hebrew.</i>

425
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,619
Rabbi, did not
a great man say...

426
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:12,631
and I quote, ''TheJews are
a swinging bunch of people.

427
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:15,133
''I mean, I've heard
of persecution...

428
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:18,171
''but what they went through
is ridiculous.

429
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:21,139
''But the great thing is
after thousands of years...

430
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,971
''of holding on
and fighting...

431
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:24,476
they finally made it.''

432
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:25,773
End quote.

433
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:28,314
I never heard
the plight of my people...

434
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:29,974
phrased so eloquently.

435
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,483
Was that Rabbi Hillel?

436
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:32,143
Nope.

437
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,345
Judah the Pious?

438
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,478
Maimonides?

439
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:35,988
The Dead Sea Scrolls!

440
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:37,751
I'm afraid not, Rabbi.

441
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:40,658
<i>It's from Yes, I Can,
by Sammy Davis,Jr.</i>

442
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:42,786
An entertainer,
like your son.

443
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:44,763
The candy man?

444
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:48,928
Maybe I'm completely upside down
on this whole problem.

445
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,368
All the years of joy
that I've lost.

446
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:53,906
Why? Because of
my stubborn ways.

447
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,442
There, there, Rabbi.

448
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:59,479
It's not too late.

449
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,315
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

450
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:09,014
Hi, kids.

451
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,353
Today's show's going to be...

452
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:14,690
the funniest, side-splittingest
cavalcade of--

453
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,353
Aw, the hell with it.

454
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,761
Roll the cartoon.

455
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:28,971
Oh, yeah. My old friends,
right next to my heart.

456
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,634
Hey, such
a filthy habit.

457
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:31,575
Who asked you?

458
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:33,208
Father?

459
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,871
Son.

460
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:34,470
Papa!

461
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:35,139
Herschel!

462
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:36,147
Daddy!

463
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:37,308
<i>Boychick!</i>

464
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:38,942
Oh, Daddy!

465
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:42,483
You're on, Krusty.

466
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:43,648
Oh, uh--

467
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:45,487
Boys and girls...

468
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,995
I'd like to be serious
for a moment, if I may.

469
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:49,994
Spotlight, please.

470
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:50,995
I just wanted--

471
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:51,996
I just want--

472
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:53,032
Come on, guys.

473
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,091
I'm not doing
the spotlight bit.

474
00:20:55,168 --> 00:21:00,196
Let's have a warm Krusty welcome
for my estranged father...

475
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:02,037
Rabbi Hyman Krustofski.

476
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,203
Lenny...

477
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,680
a little reconciliation music,
if you please.

478
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,352
Come on, Dad.

479
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:21,756
You know the words.

480
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,499
I got something in my eye.

481
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:30,501
Take my hankie.

482
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,559
Eeyugh!

483
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:39,475
We haven't seen each other
in 25 years!

484
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:41,138
Oh, I love you, son.

485
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:42,977
I love you, too, Daddy.

486
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,143
<i>Oy, a klop tsu deer!</i>

487
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:47,049
Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk!

488
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,510
Shh!
