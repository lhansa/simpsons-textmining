00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:07,489
<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:07,388
D'oh!

3
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,001
Forgot there was
a physical today, huh?

4
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,161
Yeah.

5
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:35,797
Hey, Homer, can I borrow
your underwear?

6
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:36,931
Nah.

7
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,497
This can't be right.

8
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:40,475
This man has 1 04% body fat.

9
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:42,409
Hey, no eating in the tank.

10
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,639
Go to hell.

11
00:01:43,714 --> 00:01:45,739
How was your day at work, dear?

12
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:48,376
Oh, the usual--
stand in front of this.

13
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:50,010
Open that. Pull down this.

14
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:51,952
Bend over. Spread apart that.

15
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:54,047
Turn your head that way. Cough.

16
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:55,421
<i>Sir, I'm afraid...</i>

17
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:56,959
Homer Simpson is sterile.

18
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:57,959
Who?

19
00:01:58,028 --> 00:01:59,928
A cabbagehead from sector 7-G.

20
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:02,090
Take a look at this sperm sample.

21
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,369
Eww.

22
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,704
Now, compare this
with a normal sperm sample.

23
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,902
Oh, yes.

24
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:17,037
I'm afraid radiation
from the plant is the reason.

25
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:18,706
He could sue for millions.

26
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:19,874
Mother of pearl.

27
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,212
Call my lawyers!

28
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:23,753
Let me make one thing clear.

29
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,584
I want your legal advice.

30
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:26,884
I even pay for it.

31
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:28,857
But to me, you're all vipers.

32
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:31,724
You live on personal injury,
on divorces.

33
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:33,729
You live on pain and misery!

34
00:02:33,797 --> 00:02:35,560
But I'm rambling.

35
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:37,065
Anybody want coffee?

36
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:38,260
I'll have coffee.

37
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:39,962
Want it black, don't you?

38
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:41,402
Black like your heart.

39
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:42,905
It's so hard to listen.

40
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:44,907
I hate you all so much!

41
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:48,411
I'm sorry. It's my problem.
I'll deal with it.

42
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,639
Please continue.

43
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:52,079
If you offer Mr. Simpson
a couple thou...

44
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:53,377
he'll be so dazzled...

45
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,419
he'll sign anything
you shove under his nose.

46
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:58,079
Oh, a cash settlement.

47
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:02,319
I could have figured that out,
you buttoned-down maggot!

48
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,154
You have cream?

49
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:05,024
Yes. Where are my manners?

50
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:09,755
Yeah, I used to be rich.

51
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,563
I owned Mickey Mouse
massage parlors.

52
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:15,400
Then those Disney sleazeballs
shut me down.

53
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:19,067
I said, ''I'll change the logo--
put Mickey's pants on.''

54
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:21,406
Some guys
you just can't reason with.

55
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:24,106
I used to own
a successful car company.

56
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:27,116
My strategy was giving them
Japanese names.

57
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:29,584
You ever drive
a Tempura hatchback?

58
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:30,813
- Oh, yeah.
- Sure.

59
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:32,583
I got hit by one of those.

60
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:34,783
Yeah, life was sweet.

61
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:39,659
Then I found out
I had a long-lost half brother.

62
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:41,863
Homer?

63
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:43,593
Herb?

64
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,999
<i>I let him design
a car that would...</i>

65
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,060
<i>make or break my company.</i>

66
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,629
Presenting the Homer.

67
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:57,671
I'm ruined!

68
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:59,443
<i>Forbes called it::</i>

69
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,845
Overblown, don't you think?

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,182
What about New Coke?

71
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:06,222
Hey! I invented that.

72
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,918
Yeah, but all that's
in the past...

73
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:12,189
because this is America,
and in America...

74
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:15,629
you're never finished
as long as you've got a brain...

75
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:18,793
because all a man
really needs is an idea.

76
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:20,564
- Well, I'm licked.
- Me too.

77
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,127
<i>Now, the next event...</i>

78
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,036
in our living room Olympics--

79
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:25,631
the controversial couch vault.

80
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,643
I do this for Stainmaster carpets...

81
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,179
proud sponsor
of the living room Olympics.

82
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:38,182
What the hell are you..?

83
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:40,384
Oh, my couch!

84
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,391
The arms, the seat--

85
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,154
The dream is over.

86
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:45,592
Who did this?

87
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:47,391
We were sitting on the couch...

88
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:49,398
when we heard a creaking noise.

89
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:52,492
We leapt off just in time
to see it collapse.

90
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:53,501
There, there.

91
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,538
You're safe now, little sister.

92
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:58,769
Why did this have to happen now
during prime time...

93
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,709
when TV's brightest stars
come out to shine?

94
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:04,372
Oh, good-bye, old girl.

95
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:07,178
We've had a lot of great memories.

96
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,582
That's right. I shotJ.R.

97
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:14,387
Except for huge gaps
in the western states...

98
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,291
Hands Across America
was a complete success.

99
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,159
Well, I never thought I'd see it.

100
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,703
They're dancing
on the Berlin Wall.

101
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,968
These live and lively lovers
of liberation...

102
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,372
Boring.

103
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:35,707
Sorry I ruined
your date, Sergeant Carter.

104
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:36,871
Pyle!

105
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:42,646
Well, friend, you're going
back where you came from--

106
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,914
the curb in front
of Flanders's house.

107
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:46,546
Now, let's see.

108
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,056
I need an idea.

109
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,821
Idea... idea!

110
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:52,657
What's the matter with me?

111
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,822
I used to have hundreds of ideas.

112
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,389
What do you want?

113
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,196
I just changed your diaper.

114
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:00,531
Are you hungry?

115
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:01,696
Are you cold?

116
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:02,898
Do you want to go home?

117
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:05,100
Lady, you just gave me...

118
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,439
the idea of a lifetime.

119
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:08,500
How do I thank you?

120
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:09,476
Don't hurt me.

121
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:10,638
Consider it done.

122
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:13,114
Hey, pal, I heard about the couch.

123
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:15,048
Yeah, you going to be okay?

124
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:18,679
Yeah. You know, my life
just can't get any worse.

125
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,022
That's right.

126
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:28,690
There's no way my life
could possibly get any worse.

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,228
Simpson, report to Mr. Burns's office.

128
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:34,327
D'oh!

129
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:37,032
Is this the one
with the lazy sperm?

130
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:38,301
Mm-hmm.

131
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,401
Ah, Simpson,
you big, virile son of a gun...

132
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,742
would you like
a check for $2,000?

133
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:44,712
Would I!

134
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,078
All you have to do...

135
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:47,446
is sign this form.

136
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:50,350
I'm not signing anything
until I read it...

137
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,014
or somebody gives me
the gist of it.

138
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,318
Ooh. All right.

139
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:57,155
Well, it just explains
that you've...

140
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,819
won--yes, that's it--

141
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:01,728
won the first annual...

142
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,493
Montgomery Burns...

143
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,832
uh... Award for...

144
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:10,669
Outstanding Achievement
in the Field of...

145
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,038
Excellence.

146
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,509
Don't I get some kind of trophy?

147
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,478
And a big awards ceremony?

148
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,169
Yes. That was Bonita DeWolf...

149
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:43,968
and the Springfield
Nuclear Plant Soft-shoe Society.

150
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,406
This is the biggest farce
I ever saw.

151
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:47,841
What about the Emmys?

152
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:49,071
I stand corrected.

153
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,307
And now, to present the award...

154
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:54,282
here's former
heavyweight champion...

155
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:55,841
Smokin'Joe Frazier.

156
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:01,490
Webster's Dictionary
defines excellence...

157
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:05,324
as ''the quality or condition
of being excellent.''

158
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:06,794
And now the winner...

159
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,162
of the first annual
Montgomery Burns Award...

160
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:13,896
for Outstanding Achievement
in the Field of Excellence.

161
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,096
Please, please...

162
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:16,332
You know you won.

163
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:17,373
Don't jinx it.

164
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,375
The winner: Homer Simpson.

165
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,308
Oh, my God!

166
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,471
I win!

167
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,407
Keep those
pickled eggs coming.

168
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,671
You cleaned me out.

169
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:42,734
What's the matter, Homer?

170
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:43,779
Cummerbund tight?

171
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,109
I miss my couch.

172
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:46,672
I know how you feel.

173
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,183
You lost the couch.

174
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:50,549
I lost the heavyweight championship.

175
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,019
Heavyweight championship.

176
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:53,350
There's three of those.

177
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:55,323
That couch was one of a kind.

178
00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:57,087
I know things are tough now...

179
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,492
but one day, you'll be walking along...

180
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:01,326
and see a piece of furniture...

181
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,025
you can love just as much.

182
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:04,566
Hey, Frazier, shut up!

183
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:07,034
You been riding
my back all night.

184
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:09,537
Oh, yeah?
Care to step outside?

185
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,039
Let's do it.

186
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,713
I think I'm going to take a walk.

187
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:21,080
All right! A peanut.

188
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:25,917
I'm telling you,
all a man needs is an idea...

189
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,581
and I've got an idea.

190
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:29,887
Then how come
you're still a bum?

191
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,053
All right.
A man needs two things--

192
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:35,689
an idea and money
to get it off the ground.

193
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:37,858
Hello, what's this?

194
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,170
Hmm.

195
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:46,869
Any of you guys know...

196
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:48,877
which freight goes to Springfield?

197
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,973
Uh-uh.

198
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:54,641
No.

199
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:56,117
No.

200
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,881
That's the one!

201
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:05,055
I feel so empty,
so alone, so couchless.

202
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,897
Wow! The Spinemelter 2000.

203
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:15,095
Give me full power.

204
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:15,694
But, sir...

205
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:16,761
Damn it!

206
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,273
I said full power.

207
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,097
<i>Dad?</i>

208
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,063
Dad?

209
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:47,262
I'll take it.

210
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,862
This chair is $2,000.

211
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:52,908
We can buy a whole
living room set for that.

212
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:55,206
There's an empty spot inside me.

213
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,576
I tried to fill it
with family, religion...

214
00:10:57,647 --> 00:11:00,241
community service,
but those were dead ends.

215
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,444
I think this chair is the answer.

216
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,487
We can't just spend this money...

217
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:06,545
on some creature comfort.

218
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,023
All right, we won't get the chair.

219
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,583
Now excuse me while I kiss the sky.

220
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,264
Hmm...

221
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,274
Yes?

222
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,608
Oh, sorry,
I must have the wrong house.

223
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,806
That's where
you're wrong, friend.

224
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,405
Today's our tithe day...

225
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:35,781
and we've got ourselves a transient.

226
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:36,784
Come in, my friend.

227
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:39,151
Let us feed and bathe you.

228
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:41,884
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Dad, can I anoint the sores on his feet?

229
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,188
I think it's Mom's turn, son.

230
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,784
Oh, no fair.

231
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:47,124
Thanks for the suit.

232
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:49,290
If you ever want to spend the night...

233
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:52,062
Maude and I
can sleep on card tables.

234
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,633
They're singing again.

235
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,142
Lousy neighbors.

236
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:02,678
Wish I was deaf.

237
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:06,613
What am I going to say?

238
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,844
This is the guy who ruined me.

239
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:11,386
But on the other hand, he's family.

240
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:14,651
So many conflicting emotions.
How to express them?

241
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:16,590
Herb?

242
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,562
Uncky Herb!

243
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:23,894
Bart! Lisa!

244
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,730
I'm so glad to see you.

245
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:27,793
You weren't so glad to see me.

246
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,237
I'm sorry, but I'm still mad at you.

247
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:33,571
Every word you say
makes me want to punch you.

248
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:36,635
In my home, could you
just kick me in the butt?

249
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:39,546
I'll try, but I'm not
making any promises.

250
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:41,584
Herb!
How have you been?

251
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:43,881
I've been living
in a cardboard box...

252
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:46,979
sleeping on grates,
eating out of Dumpsters. You?

253
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,421
Can't complain.

254
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:50,254
Let me give you the grand tour.

255
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:52,817
This is one
of our many light switches.

256
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:55,558
It functions
in both the on and off mode.

257
00:12:55,632 --> 00:12:57,429
On, off. On, off.

258
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,661
He knows how to work a light switch.

259
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:00,998
Oh, yeah, right.

260
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,628
I don't know what this switch does.

261
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,236
This is really good, Marge.

262
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,336
I got the recipe from
the Utility Grade Beef Council.

263
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:11,937
They do good work.

264
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:14,984
Uncky Herb, what advice
would you give to a boy...

265
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:18,077
who will most likely become
a bum like yourself?

266
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:19,746
Discarded pizza boxes...

267
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:22,087
are an inexpensive source of cheese.

268
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:24,592
Lisa, aren't you happy to see me?

269
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:26,424
Why didn't you write?

270
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:27,929
What would I say?

271
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:29,487
'' Dear Lisa, last night...

272
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:32,262
I used a rat for a pillow
thanks to your pop''?

273
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:33,825
I see your point.

274
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:45,040
Maggie, I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

275
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:48,208
You're going to make me rich again.

276
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:50,218
Yes, you are.

277
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,015
Yes, you are.

278
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,386
One, two, three...
Ventnor Avenue.

279
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:56,186
And while on Ventnor Avenue...

280
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,057
you'll be staying
at the fabulous Hotel Lisa.

281
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,096
A valet will be around shortly...

282
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,654
to park your thimble.

283
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:05,496
There is the unpleasant matter
of the bill.

284
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:06,830
Get to the point.

285
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:08,427
1 1 50 bones.

286
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:11,496
That's all I got.

287
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,371
Broke again, eh, Herb?

288
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:15,343
Just like in real life.

289
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:18,847
I guess you're just not
much of a businessman.

290
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:21,076
Maybe we should play
another game.

291
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,015
Why are we playing games...

292
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:25,452
when we got two grand in the bank?

293
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:28,491
Dad won the First Annual
Montgomery Burns Award.

294
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:29,991
We should invest in a set...

295
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:32,527
of''Great Books
of Western Civilization.''

296
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,189
<i>Look at this ad
from New Republic for Kids.</i>

297
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:37,995
'' Each month, a new classic
will be delivered.

298
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,535
<i>''Paradise Regained,
Martin Chuzzlewit...</i>

299
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:43,800
<i>or Herman Melville's
twin classics, Omoo and Typee. ''</i>

300
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:46,865
Marge, didn't you want
that vibrating chair?

301
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:48,570
That was your idea.

302
00:14:48,645 --> 00:14:50,408
We should get a machine gun.

303
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,471
We could hunt game,
spell out things...

304
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,073
or ring in the new year.

305
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,483
I really think we need
to replace the washer and dryer.

306
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:03,455
How would you like
to spend $2,000

307
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:06,086
to give a broken man
a second chance?

308
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:07,254
Nah.

309
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,059
What are you talking about?

310
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:10,565
Not here.

311
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,191
Come into the dining room.

312
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,168
I have a 20-minute presentation...

313
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:15,898
that will change the world.

314
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:18,406
20 minutes? Oh...

315
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:21,204
Okay, now before I tell you
about my idea...

316
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:23,336
I'd like to show you this.

317
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,185
It's drinking the water!

318
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:32,653
Take it easy, Homer.

319
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:34,019
This is an example...

320
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,991
of how one little idea,
carefully marketed--

321
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,585
This is the greatest invention
in the world.

322
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:41,755
You'll make a million dollars.

323
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,163
No, that invention
is out already.

324
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,497
I'm just using it as an example.

325
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:49,538
It's going back for more.

326
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,437
Oh...

327
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,600
<i>Homer, this is my invention.</i>

328
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,008
Now of course,
with these blueprints...

329
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,569
you'll have to use...

330
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:00,241
your imagination.

331
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:03,479
What the-- Hmmm.

332
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:09,049
It's a baby translator.

333
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,592
It measures the pitch...

334
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,925
the frequency, and the urgency
of a baby's cries.

335
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:16,761
Then it tells whoever's around
in plain English...

336
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,233
exactly what the baby is trying to say.

337
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:21,202
Everything from ''change me''

338
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,568
to ''turn off
that damn Raffi record.''

339
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,574
That's a very clever idea.

340
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:28,338
All I need is
a couple of thousand dollars...

341
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:29,901
to build a prototype.

342
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,674
You'll have your money back...

343
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:33,113
in 30 days, I swear.

344
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:35,150
We owe a debt to Uncky Herb.

345
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:37,448
He took us in
and Dad destroyed him.

346
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,080
Some shyster will bilk you
out of your money.

347
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:42,147
It may as well be your brother.

348
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:44,216
I'll lend you the 2,000 bucks...

349
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:47,888
but you have to forgive me
and treat me like a brother.

350
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:48,555
No.

351
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:49,563
Then give me...

352
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:50,929
the drinking bird.

353
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:56,926
What could you be saying?

354
00:16:58,002 --> 00:16:59,799
Nothing downstairs.

355
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:01,634
You just took a nap.

356
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:05,141
''I want to suck your nose.''

357
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:07,575
Hooga-booga, hooga-booga.

358
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,146
''I'm scared.''

359
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:12,204
Hmm...

360
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:14,114
The amplitude of the sine wave...

361
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:15,948
is insufficient for ''burp me''

362
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,284
and this sawtooth formation
seems to...

363
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:19,288
Blah!

364
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:20,881
Eureka.

365
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,892
Now, I bet you're all wondering...

366
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,450
what lies under this sheet.

367
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:27,225
No. We peeked
while you were in the john.

368
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,390
Oh.

369
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,229
Well, here it is again...

370
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:32,565
my baby translator.

371
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:36,539
Ooh!

372
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:37,972
Marge, you don't have to humor me.

373
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:39,236
Well, it's pretty ingrained.

374
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,743
What do you think, Homer?

375
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:43,406
This is the stupidest
thing I've ever seen.

376
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,416
I can't believe
we blew 2,000 bucks on it...

377
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:47,746
when right now...

378
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,810
rollers could be kneading
my buttocks.

379
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,855
Could you stop thinking
about your ass?

380
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:54,255
I try, but I can't.

381
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,057
Lavish attention on me...

382
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:58,254
and entertain me.

383
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:00,160
Oh, Maggie, you talked!

384
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:01,459
You see?

385
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:04,262
It tells you exactly
what's on the baby's mind.

386
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:05,267
Maggie.

387
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:06,268
Maggie.

388
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:08,437
Where did you go?

389
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:09,598
Peekaboo!

390
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:11,937
Oh, there you are.

391
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:12,941
Very amusing.

392
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,944
Homer, now what do you think?

393
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:15,979
I don't know, Herb.

394
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,174
People are afraid of new things.

395
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:20,274
You should have taken
an existing product...

396
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:21,613
and put a clock in it.

397
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,620
Homer, every mother
in the country...

398
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,212
will want one of these.

399
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:28,650
I have soiled myself.

400
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:29,886
How embarrassing.

401
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:33,390
I gave Herb all my money...

402
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:37,798
and he still treats me like
something he dug out of his ear.

403
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:40,235
He can't stay mad at you forever.

404
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:41,635
<i>He is your brother.</i>

405
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:44,004
When is he going
to act like it?

406
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:56,385
This radio-controlled plane...

407
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:58,718
gives your baby the chance to fly...

408
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,256
just like my son here.

409
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:04,920
He can execute the barrel roll,
the loop-the-loop...

410
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:07,590
and bring it in
for the perfect landing.

411
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,598
Oh, dear.

412
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,760
My wife is going to kill me.

413
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:18,172
I only want to eat candy.

414
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,766
Then that's all you'll get.

415
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,109
This leash demeans us both.

416
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:24,576
I'll take two!

417
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:25,274
I'll take a dozen!

418
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:26,338
I represent...

419
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,112
the Precious Baby Discount Stores.

420
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:29,209
I'll take 50,000!

421
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:30,948
I'm rich again!

422
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:31,954
U.S.A.!

423
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:33,285
U.S.A.!

424
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:34,722
U.S.A.!

425
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,020
<i>Homer...</i>

426
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,357
here's a check for $2,000.

427
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,863
I also wanted to give you
each something...

428
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:42,229
for believing in me.

429
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,291
Lisa, this is the first volume...

430
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,632
of''the Great Books
of Western Civilization.''

431
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:48,797
You'll receive a new one every month...

432
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:50,932
<i>from Beowolf to Less Than Zero.</i>

433
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:54,239
<i>Finally a copy of Ethan Frome
to call my own.</i>

434
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,473
You're too young
for that machine gun...

435
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:58,139
but I'm giving you something...

436
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:01,150
that will make sure
when you're old enough...

437
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,981
you can still buy one...

438
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,614
a membership in the National
Rifle Association.

439
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,021
Wow! The N.R.A.!

440
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:10,322
Can I get armor-piercing,
cyanide-tipped bullets?

441
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,986
It's in the Constitution.

442
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:13,394
Maggie...

443
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:14,897
who brought me my fortune...

444
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:16,228
I'll give you...

445
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,234
anything you want in this world.

446
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:21,728
I want what the dog's eating.

447
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:22,329
D'oh!

448
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:23,236
I'll get you...

449
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,433
something nice.

450
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:25,941
Now, Marge...

451
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,944
Herb, I don't need any gift.

452
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:29,445
You're too late, Marge.

453
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:31,606
I got you a new washer and dryer...

454
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:34,048
and sold the old ones for 50 bucks.

455
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,181
- Come on, washer!

456
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,323
Oh, you stupid dryer!

457
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:43,621
Herb, I don't think...

458
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:46,686
there's a vibrating chair
in that bag for me.

459
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:48,959
Homer, walk me to my car.

460
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:51,296
What do I get?

461
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:54,634
It's not another
punch in the face, is it?

462
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,639
This is what you get, Homer.

463
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:57,935
I forgive you.

464
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,739
You can call me brother,
and I can do the same.

465
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:01,743
That's it?

466
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:02,972
That's it.

467
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,811
I see your point... brother.

468
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:07,783
Give me a hug... brother.

469
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:08,978
All right...

470
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,988
but I never really
hugged a man before.

471
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,661
Homer, I bought you the damn chair.

472
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:21,993
Get out of here.

473
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,328
Go on,
that's enough.

474
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:24,629
Get out of here.

475
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,832
Shh!
