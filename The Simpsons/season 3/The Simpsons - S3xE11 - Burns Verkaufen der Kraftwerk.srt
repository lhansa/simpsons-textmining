<i>## The Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:06,354
D'oh!

3
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:28,857
It's formulated to rinse clean
with no oily deposits.

4
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,988
Hot dog.

5
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:31,861
And mild enough to use daily.

6
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,798
Isn't life grand?

7
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,130
What's wrong, sir?

8
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:37,033
Did I get some in your eyes?

9
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:40,198
The shampoo specifically said,
''No more tears.''

10
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,468
A lovely promise...

11
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:44,477
but one beyond the powers
of a mere shampoo.

12
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:46,809
There's something
you're not telling me.

13
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,475
Perhaps you'd talk to
Snappy the alligator?

14
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,574
Maybe.

15
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,743
Hello, Mr. Burns.

16
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,616
Snappy, it's hard to imagine...

17
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:57,215
but I was once a barefoot boy
with cheek of tan.

18
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,589
I dreamed of grand slam home runs...

19
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,289
and wiping out nations
with the stroke of a pen.

20
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:05,059
There's still time for that.

21
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:06,292
Is there?

22
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,598
Controlled nuclear fission
is a demanding mistress.

23
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,264
So you feel resentful
towards the plant.

24
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,602
Yes, exactly!

25
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:16,541
You know, maybe it's time
I sold the old girl.

26
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:21,640
Mmm!... Hmm?!

27
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:23,411
D'oh!

28
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:25,179
Ohh, what do they want?

29
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:27,516
Maybe a nap will boost my spirits.

30
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:30,523
I'll get that whale song
cassette you like, sir.

31
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:31,853
Oh, it's not fair!

32
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,887
I know how you feel, Simpson.

33
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:37,260
I've never seen Mr. Burns
so depressed.

34
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:40,630
People think because he's
rich and powerful and cruel...

35
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:43,431
he doesn't have feelings,
but he does.

36
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:47,497
I bet he wouldn't sell
the plant for $1 00 million.

37
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,338
Ooh, that's a lot of money.

38
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,900
D'oh!

39
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,570
Uh... Mr. Smithers...

40
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:54,740
do you have change for a dollar?

41
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:56,077
Good, good--

42
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,617
try to eat something.

43
00:02:58,686 --> 00:02:59,948
Homer Simpson here.

44
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:01,579
It's your stockbroker.

45
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,248
Your stock in the plant...

46
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:06,122
<i>just went up for the first time
in ten years.</i>

47
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:07,217
I own stock?

48
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:08,625
All employees got some...

49
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:12,063
in exchange for waiving
certain constitutional rights.

50
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,124
So, how much did it go up?

51
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,101
The book says to make small talk...

52
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,195
before getting down to business.

53
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:19,796
- Everybody alive?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:20,966
- Like any sports?
- Sure.

55
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,304
- Ever go dancing?
- Not anymore.

56
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:23,604
- We should get together sometime.
- That'd be great.

57
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,043
There.
Now we trust each other.

58
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:27,171
<i>Well, how are you?</i>

59
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,443
Near death!

60
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,543
I renew my notary license
on a weekly basis.

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,019
So what's my stock up to?

62
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,114
Let me punch that up
on the computer.

63
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:38,783
Uh... 25¢ a share.

64
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,292
What should I do?

65
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:44,127
Let me put it this way--
you'll get $25 if you sell now.

66
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:45,290
Sell! Sell! Sell!

67
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:46,628
Whoo-hoo!

68
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:51,536
Twenty-five dollars!

69
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,903
Ooh!

70
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:56,568
Mmm... hot wax.

71
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,510
Oh, hammer.

72
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,644
<i>##...Fight, fight, fight
fight, fight, fight ##</i>

73
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:06,744
<i># The Itchy & Scratchy Show #</i>

74
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:17,687
Mmm.

75
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:23,670
Bart, turn to
the Financial Channel.

76
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,901
Aunt Patty says our stock
is skyrocketing.

77
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:29,238
Unconfirmed takeover rumors...

78
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,837
have pushed Burns Worldwide
from 1 /8 to 52 and a quarter.

79
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:39,515
Your father's stock
is worth $5,200!

80
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:42,750
Wow! 5,200 smackers!

81
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,452
Oooh!

82
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,098
Ahhh...

83
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,406
Hey, Homer.

84
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,565
Want a Duff?

85
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,233
No, I'd like a bottle...

86
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:04,869
of Henry K. Duff's
Private Reserve.

87
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,242
Are you sure?

88
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:10,306
'Cause once I open the bottle,
there's no refund.

89
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:11,783
For your information...

90
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:15,652
I just made a cool $25
playing the market.

91
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:18,089
Buy low, sell high--
that's my motto.

92
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,286
I may quit my job
at the power plant...

93
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,953
and become a full-time...

94
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:25,760
stock market guy.

95
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,095
Have a Duff, boys!

96
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,102
Oh, thank you.

97
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,936
My English is not perfect,
but I have to tell you...

98
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,100
your beer is like swill to us.

99
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,508
Only a swine would drink this beer.

100
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:38,602
Thank you, anyway.

101
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,011
You aren't from around here,
are you?

102
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,605
We are from Germany.

103
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:45,117
He is from the east;
I am from the west.

104
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:47,620
I had a big company,
he had a big company.

105
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:49,622
<i>Now we have a very big company.</i>

106
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,182
We want to buy the power plant.
Would your owner ever sell it?

107
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,785
Well, I happen to know
he won't sell it...

108
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:57,797
for less than $1 00,000,000.

109
00:05:57,865 --> 00:05:59,492
1 00,000,000?

110
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,398
<i>Ein, zwei, drei, vier, funf...</i>

111
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:02,833
Oh, don't worry.

112
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:05,895
We'll have enough left
to buy the Cleveland Browns.

113
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,804
It's the miracle...

114
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,342
we've been waiting for.

115
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,378
What are we spending it on?

116
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:15,313
Homer's probably buying
some magic beans with it.

117
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:17,213
We'll have a savings account.

118
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:18,717
We've never had one.

119
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:23,382
Kids, I think everything is
going to be okay from now on.

120
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:25,425
Hey, hey!

121
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:26,516
Oh, Homer!

122
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,561
You heard?

123
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:28,560
We heard.

124
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:29,926
Isn't it wonderful?

125
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,465
We have some great plans
for that money.

126
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,967
I'm afraid I had
some great plans too.

127
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:36,593
What do you mean?

128
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,331
I spent it on beer.

129
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:40,669
Surprise, surprise.

130
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:44,734
You spent $5,200 on beer?!

131
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:46,279
$5,200?

132
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:48,440
What are you talking about?

133
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:49,573
What?

134
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,287
I sold it all for 25 bucks!

135
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,922
- Oww!
- Come on, everybody.

136
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:00,153
It makes you feel better.

137
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,795
Hey, Homer.

138
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:10,359
Did you buy this car
with your stock money?

139
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:12,735
Sure did,
and the great thing about it...

140
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:14,239
is everybody got rich.

141
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,742
For once
us working stiffs got a break.

142
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:25,742
Wait till you see Lenny.

143
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,379
He just got back from
the plastic surgeon.

144
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,787
Lenny, looks like you
got the works.

145
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:34,225
It started as an eye tuck,
but the stock kept climbing.

146
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:35,227
Come here.

147
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:37,560
Mr. Burns is on TV.

148
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:38,655
Mr. Burns?

149
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:40,063
Here, Mr. Burns.

150
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:41,066
Over here.

151
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:42,329
Mr. Burns.

152
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:46,032
We've heard a German consortium
offered to purchase the plant.

153
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,368
Any comments?

154
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,636
You'll see the Statue of Liberty
wearing lederhosen...

155
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,871
before you'll see Germans
running my plant!

156
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:54,210
Then why are you meeting with them?

157
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:57,876
So I can look Uncle Fritz
square in the monocle...

158
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:59,385
<i>and say, ''Nein.!''</i>

159
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,587
You never cease to amaze me, sir.

160
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,334
Hmm?

161
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:20,433
Whoo-hoo!

162
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:21,735
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

163
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:22,935
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

164
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:26,438
I grudgingly accept.

165
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,288
Now, don't worry.

166
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:38,917
You'll find these two gentlemen
are as American as apple pie.

167
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,255
Hans and Fritz--

168
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:42,420
Why, that's justJohn and Frank.

169
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:44,657
<i>Ich bin ein Springfielder.</i>

170
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,757
They'll bring their own people in.

171
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:47,994
This ain't good.

172
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,831
We could all lose our jobs.

173
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,030
Look at all those
worried faces...

174
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,573
except for Lenny.

175
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,267
He looks great.

176
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:59,313
This is the worst day of my life.

177
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:03,213
Those Germans can't fire me.

178
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:05,445
I'm the only one who can
unjam the rod dissociator.

179
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,781
They can't fire me.

180
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,789
I run the gaseous contaminant
particularifier.

181
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:11,381
They can't fire me.

182
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,084
- Why?
- Why?

183
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,719
'Cause...

184
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,729
<i>Guten morgen.</i>

185
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:17,786
I am Horst.

186
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:19,127
I'm speaking with you...

187
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,293
because I am
the most nonthreatening.

188
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:23,802
Perhaps I remind you
of lovable Sergeant Schultz...

189
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:25,065
<i>on Hogan's Heroes.</i>

190
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,299
Oh, yeah.

191
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:27,738
Yeah, he does.

192
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,241
What is the best way...

193
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,141
to an efficient plant?

194
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,146
- I don't know.
- Well, uh...

195
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,408
Search me.

196
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:37,178
Happy workers who feel secure
at their jobs--

197
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:39,719
So let's get to
know each other better.

198
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,982
Do we have any alcoholics among us?

199
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:42,988
Uh... me.

200
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:43,989
Right here.

201
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:45,423
I'm drunk right now.

202
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:47,654
You'll be given
a six-week treatment...

203
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,958
at our drying-out facility
in Hawaii...

204
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,328
after which
you'll return at full pay.

205
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,593
- Oh, great!
- Great.

206
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,329
Hey, maybe I'll marry
Elizabeth Taylor.

207
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:57,335
Lucky drunks.

208
00:09:57,404 --> 00:09:59,497
We cannot uber-emphasize...

209
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:01,871
the importance of employee safety.

210
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:04,536
We plan to have
some frank discussions...

211
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,512
with your safety inspector.

212
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,014
Yeah, sock it to 'em, Horst!

213
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,345
Psst. Hey, Homer.

214
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,885
Aren't you the safety inspector?

215
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:13,885
D'oh!

216
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:18,516
Mm-hmm-hmm...

217
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:20,253
mm-hmm...

218
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,386
That's one big check.

219
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,192
You look sharp today, sir.

220
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:26,859
<i>You looken sharpen todayen,
mein herr.</i>

221
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,868
<i>You looken sharpen todayen,
mein herr.</i>

222
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,201
That was a gutsy decision, sir.

223
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:33,968
Smithers, come here.

224
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,906
I wanted to give you something...

225
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,967
and I know you
wanted this photo...

226
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:39,535
of Elvis and me.

227
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,137
He was good to his mother.

228
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:44,480
Yes, but I couldn't understand
a word that man said.

229
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:46,645
''Mr. Burns...

230
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,347
...hound dog.''

231
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:49,480
Stop it.

232
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,720
You're killing me, sir.

233
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,624
Sir, what will you do next?

234
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,596
I'll get that new hip
I've been hankering for.

235
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:58,597
Then, who knows?

236
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,327
Beekeeping? Boxing?

237
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:01,663
Bocce ball?

238
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:04,670
The world is my oyster, Smithers.

239
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,000
Farewell.

240
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,510
Lisa, your father needs your help.

241
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:16,015
Do you know anything about Germany?

242
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,176
Well, it's a country in Europe.

243
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:19,514
Good. I'm learning.

244
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:21,521
An economic power of the world.

245
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:23,523
Because we send them money?

246
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:25,252
No.

247
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:29,319
They're efficient and punctual,
with a strong work ethic.

248
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,328
D'oh!

249
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:31,523
Oh, woe is me.

250
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,032
Homie, come to bed.

251
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,193
Oh, Marge, I'm going to be fired.

252
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,201
I know it.

253
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,464
Don't worry.

254
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:41,133
Whatever happens,
we'll pay the bills somehow.

255
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,108
Marge, it's not the money.

256
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,906
My job is my identity.

257
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:48,608
If I'm not a safety ''whatchamajigger,''
I''m nothing.

258
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:50,479
Well, if you can't sleep...

259
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:53,918
why don't you do
something constructive?

260
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:56,422
<i>Ooh... Battlestar Galactica.!</i>

261
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,254
Fit, damn you! Fit!

262
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,166
There.

263
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,966
Yo, Homer, you got
to get ready for work.

264
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:15,974
Uh-huh.

265
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:16,975
What?

266
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:24,007
What am I gonna--

267
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:25,016
Hey, you!

268
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,019
Stop being... so unsafe!

269
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,112
Smitty... safen up.

270
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:30,349
Could we have a word?

271
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:31,391
No.

272
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,358
I must have phrased that badly.

273
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:34,860
My English is inelegant.

274
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,021
I meant to say...

275
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:38,394
may we have a brief,
friendly chat?

276
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:39,056
No.

277
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,225
Failed again.

278
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,633
''We request
the pleasure of your company...

279
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:44,466
for a free exchange of ideas.''

280
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:45,971
Nooo!

281
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,304
You've been safety inspector
for two years.

282
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,809
What initiatives
have you spearheaded?

283
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,778
Uh... all of them?

284
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:54,870
I see.

285
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,974
Then you must have
some good ideas...

286
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:58,541
for the future as well.

287
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:00,849
I sure do!

288
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:06,556
Such as?

289
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:09,323
Well, uh...
I wish the candy machine...

290
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:13,230
wasn't so picky about taking
beat-up dollar bills...

291
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,767
because...

292
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,736
a lot of workers
really like candy.

293
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,170
We understand, Homer.

294
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:22,333
After all, we are from
the land of chocolate.

295
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,817
Wow... chocolate, half-price!

296
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:08,814
# La la la-la-la-la-la #

297
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,981
Mr. Simpson.

298
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,251
# La-la-la-la-la #

299
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,087
Mr. Simpson?

300
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,593
Huh? Oh, sorry.

301
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,253
We were talking about chocolate?

302
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,490
That was ten minutes ago.

303
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,828
I think I did
pretty good in there.

304
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,834
Yeah, those Germans aren't so bad.

305
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,668
Sure, they've made mistakes in the past,
but that's why pencils have erasers.

306
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,001
<i>Attention, workers.</i>

307
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,872
We have completed our evaluation.

308
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:33,003
<i>We regret to announce
the following layoffs...</i>

309
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,344
<i>which I will read
in alphabetical order.</i>

310
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,509
<i>Simpson, Homer.</i>

311
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:38,949
<i>That is all.</i>

312
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:57,015
<i>Ay, caramba.!</i>

313
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:01,219
Bart, Lisa did
a wonderful job on my hair.

314
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:03,625
And we saved $40
for the family.

315
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,994
We all have to pull together
till your father gets a new job.

316
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:10,592
I made some soap by squeezing
soap slivers together.

317
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:11,897
That's very clever.

318
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,406
Instead of buying comic books,
I read them in the store.

319
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,066
You shouldn't do that.

320
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:19,770
My jump rope broke,
but I tied it together.

321
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:20,777
Good, Lisa.

322
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:23,610
I didn't take a bath today
and may not take one tomorrow.

323
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,582
I want you to take baths, Bart.

324
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,709
Lousy German know-it-alls.

325
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:30,220
Who are they
to say I'm not safe?

326
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:33,257
Oh, what's the matter
with this thing?

327
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,384
No problems here.

328
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:40,064
That's right, Burnsie.
Keep your wrist supple.

329
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:42,396
Throw it, don't aim it.

330
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:48,303
This is my park.

331
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:49,169
Get out!

332
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:52,709
It was worth it.

333
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:54,245
This place has gone to hell.

334
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:57,110
It's obscene what they did
to your office.

335
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:58,843
You caught me at a bad time.

336
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,545
But my folk guitar class
has been canceled.

337
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,282
Would you like to get together
for a drink?

338
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:05,050
Would I?!

339
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:06,090
I got to go.

340
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:07,420
See you at 6:00.

341
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:13,588
You're going down, my friend.

342
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:14,927
Yes, sir, Mr. Burns.

343
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,332
That shouldn't be.

344
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,196
<i>Ach du lieber.!
Raccoons!</i>

345
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,366
That's right.

346
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,740
Gather the nectar,
my little drones...

347
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:27,369
and make the honey--

348
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,380
honey for your children.

349
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,380
Fools!

350
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,542
Ready for that drink, sir?

351
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,585
Just a second.

352
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,712
Let me introduce you to the gang.

353
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,221
That's Buzz, that's Honey.

354
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,884
And you see that queen?
Her name is Smithers.

355
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,154
That's very flattering,
but we should go.

356
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,219
Several bees are stinging me.

357
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,924
<i>Moe's Tavern.</i>

358
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:47,657
Moe speaking.

359
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:48,892
I'm looking...

360
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,492
for a Mrs. O'Problem,
first name: Bea.

361
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,061
Uh...just a minute, I'll check.

362
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,333
Uh... Bea O'Problem?

363
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:56,567
Bea O'Problem?

364
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,733
Come on, guys.

365
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,243
Do I have a Bea O'Problem here?

366
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,279
You sure do.

367
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:05,477
Oh! It's you, isn't it?

368
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:10,243
When I get you, I'm gonna
use your head for a bucket...

369
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,256
and paint my house
with your brains.

370
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,620
Bart, I want you to go down
to Moe's Tavern.

371
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,993
I need you to bring
your father home.

372
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,271
Excuse me.

373
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,035
I'm looking for...

374
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,040
Wait a minute.

375
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:32,406
I know that voice.

376
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:34,604
If it isn't little Bart Simpson!

377
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,876
I haven't seen you in years.

378
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:38,881
That's right.

379
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,042
That's my pop.

380
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:41,176
Oh, little Bart.

381
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:44,051
We hear all about your monkeyshines.

382
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:46,215
Bet you get into
all kinds of trouble...

383
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,054
he don't even know about.

384
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:49,218
Am I right?

385
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:52,058
Well, I make some crank phone calls.

386
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,223
Aw, ha-ha, that's great!

387
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,288
Ha-ha-ha!

388
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,392
Hey, would you sing
that old song...

389
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:59,061
you used to sing for me?

390
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:00,934
Moe, for you, anything.

391
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:02,564
<i>Look.!</i>

392
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:03,733
A blue-collar bar.

393
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:06,572
Oh, Smithers, let's go slumming.

394
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:24,584
Encore!

395
00:18:24,663 --> 00:18:26,255
He's a pip, this one is.

396
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:28,697
Ah, the mirthless laugh
of the damned.

397
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,200
Hold your nose, Smithers.

398
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:31,860
We're going in.

399
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,701
Watch me blend in.

400
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:38,038
Barkeep,
some cheap domestic beer...

401
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:40,043
for me and my buddy here.

402
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:43,911
I'm not your buddy,
you greedy old reptile.

403
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:46,041
Smithers, who is this saucy fellow?

404
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,049
Homer Simpson.

405
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:48,380
<i>Sector sieben-gruben--</i>

406
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:49,715
I mean, sector 7-G.

407
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,221
Recently terminated.

408
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:52,551
I lost my job...

409
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:54,888
so you could have
another $1 00 million!

410
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,896
Does your money cheer you up
when you're feeling blue?

411
00:18:58,964 --> 00:18:59,555
Yes.

412
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:00,563
Bad example.

413
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:02,065
Let me ask you this:

414
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:04,226
Does your money ever hug you...

415
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:06,099
when you come home at night?

416
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,297
Why, no.

417
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:09,738
And does it ever say
''I love you''?

418
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,742
No, it doesn't.

419
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,744
# Nobody loves you #

420
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:16,747
# Nobody loves you
You're old and you're ugly #

421
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:18,783
Way to go, Homer!

422
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,839
Good heavens, Smithers.

423
00:19:19,918 --> 00:19:22,148
They're not afraid of me anymore.

424
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,279
Hey, Mr. Burns,
did you get that letter I sent?

425
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,789
Letter? I don't recall--

426
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,519
<i>That's because
I forgot to stamp it!</i>

427
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,628
Ah, that kid slays me.

428
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:34,756
That was no accident.

429
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,425
Let's get out of here.

430
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:37,468
# Na na nah nah #

431
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:39,435
# Na na nah nah #

432
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,597
#Wa-a-ave #

433
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:42,765
# Good-bye #

434
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:44,103
What good is money...

435
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:48,271
if you can't inspire terror
in your fellow man?

436
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:51,281
I've got to get my plant back.

437
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:00,518
<i>Gott in himmel.!</i>

438
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:04,289
Who'd have thought a nuclear plant
could be such a death trap?

439
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:07,763
It will cost another 1 00 million
just to bring it up to code.

440
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,803
Please sell me my plant back.

441
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:13,929
I'll pay anything.

442
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,472
What a happy coincidence!

443
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,169
You are desperate to buy,
and we are desperate to sell.

444
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:20,939
Desperate, eh?

445
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,277
Advantage: Burns.

446
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,577
This is my offer.

447
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,380
You'll find it's most unfair,
but those are the breaks.

448
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:33,356
But this is half
of what we paid you.

449
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:34,756
That's my final offer.

450
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:35,884
Take it or leave it.

451
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,258
All right, Mr. Burns, you win.

452
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:43,028
<i>But beware-- we Germans
aren't all smiles und sunshine.</i>

453
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:46,264
Ooh, the Germans are mad at me.

454
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:47,429
I'm so scared.

455
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,132
Ooh, the Germans!

456
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:49,696
Stop it.

457
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:50,934
Stop that.

458
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:52,772
The Germans are coming after me.

459
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:55,039
Stop the pretending
you are scared game.

460
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:56,045
They're so big.

461
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:57,706
Stop it, Mr. Burns.

462
00:20:57,782 --> 00:20:59,374
Protect me from the Germans!

463
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:00,383
Stop it!

464
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,914
Get out!
This is my office now!

465
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:05,455
Get out!

466
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:06,683
You too!

467
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:09,693
This is a place of business,
not a peewee flophouse!

468
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:12,261
Your orders, sir.

469
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,628
Restore my office,
cancel all repairs...

470
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:17,759
and rehire that chap
who sassed me in the bar.

471
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:19,531
Homer Simpson? But why?

472
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,629
Smithers,
I keep my friends close...

473
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,799
and my enemies even closer.

474
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,900
He'll slowly regain his confidence...

475
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:28,241
as the months and years drift by...

476
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:29,780
blissfully unaware...

477
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:33,409
that the sword of Damocles
is dangling just above his head.

478
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,189
Whoo-hoo!

479
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,123
I got my job back!

480
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,329
Shh!
