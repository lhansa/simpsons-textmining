1
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:07,894
<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,414
D'oh!

3
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:25,672
I don't need
your crummy job.

4
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:27,273
I won the lottery!

5
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:29,945
Well, I won the lottery too!

6
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,045
We both won the lottery!

7
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:34,522
Why don't you
win the lottery too?

8
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:38,390
Where everybody wins!

9
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:41,124
Actual odds of winning:
one in 380 million.

10
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:42,187
The lottery--

11
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:45,497
exploiter of the poor
and ignorant.

12
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,006
You know, I heard the jackpot's
up to $1 30 million.

13
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:53,008
$1 30 million?

14
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,408
Did you say $1 30 million?

15
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,411
Yeah.

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,174
Wow!

17
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:05,780
Here's your lottery ticket.

18
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:08,222
Thank you for knocking over
my inventory.

19
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,281
Come again.

20
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,554
Bart, I need
some lucky numbers fast.

21
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:14,222
How old are you?
What's your birthday?

22
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:15,356
No kidding.

23
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:17,366
What's Lisa's birthday?

24
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,959
What? You don't know
your sister's birthday?

25
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:21,698
Strap on
your bulletproof vest.

26
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,706
It's time
for another bank run.

27
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:24,900
If I don't make it...

28
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:27,466
promise you won't sleep
with my wife.

29
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:29,239
I promise nothing.

30
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:31,713
You'll never guess
what happened, Marge.

31
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:32,806
Are you ready?

32
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:37,582
I have a feeling
that we may win...

33
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,315
the lottery!

34
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,754
But we never, ever--

35
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:43,793
Calm down and listen
to me carefully.

36
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,920
Go get all your money--

37
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:48,157
I buy one lottery ticket a week...

38
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:50,393
with the girls
at the hair salon.

39
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:52,992
That's enough excitement for me.

40
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,164
The lottery
is the one ray of hope...

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,175
in my otherwise
unbearable life!

42
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,837
Uh, the lottery
and you.

43
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:04,005
We're on a tight budget.

44
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:06,276
Promise you won't
get carried away.

45
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,011
Yes, money-- I mean honey.

46
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:10,849
Ooh! Here comes the news
about the lottery.

47
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:12,252
Hey, down in front.

48
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:16,349
The whole state is suddenly
in the grip of lottery fever...

49
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:19,156
and Springfield is no exception.

50
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,687
<i>In fact, every copy
of ShirleyJackson's The Lottery...</i>

51
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,234
has been checked out
from the library.

52
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:28,237
The book does not contain
hints on winning the lottery.

53
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:32,435
It is a chilling tale
of conformity gone mad.

54
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:35,868
There's one big winner--

55
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,345
our state school system...

56
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:39,109
which gets
half the profits.

57
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:42,015
Just think what we can buy
with that money--

58
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:45,543
history books that know
how the Korean War came out...

59
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:48,386
and a state-of-the-art
detention hall...

60
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,292
where children are held in place
with magnets.

61
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,126
Magnets--
always with the magnets.

62
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:04,864
I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

63
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:07,604
I am going to win this lottery.

64
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:10,943
Homer, the odds
are 380 million to one.

65
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:14,950
Correction: 380 million to 50!

66
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,680
What will you do
with your share, kids?

67
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:18,778
Bank it.

68
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,186
Give it to the poor.

69
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:22,418
What do kids know
about spending money?

70
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:23,584
What about you?

71
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,786
Hmm.

72
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,091
Homer, what did you do,
get a haircut or something?

73
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,658
Look closer, Lenny.

74
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:35,762
Oh, you're the biggest man
in the world now...

75
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,864
and you're covered
in gold.

76
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:39,602
1 4-karat gold.

77
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:41,803
Take a hike, boss.

78
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:43,709
I'm running things now.

79
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,510
All hail King Homer.

80
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:02,659
We now take you
to the drawing live.

81
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,462
I've got my tickets.

82
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:06,525
They're about
to start, Chief.

83
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:08,537
No, you got
the wrong number.

84
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,470
This is 91 -- 2.

85
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:14,038
We'll be with you
in a minute, kids.

86
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,875
This could be our ticket
out of here, Mel.

87
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:19,609
I will now draw
the first winning number.

88
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:24,920
I've got so many tickets
I can't lose.

89
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:26,785
The first number is 1 7.

90
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:28,017
D'oh!

91
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,581
You can still
win money...

92
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,456
if you have
five out of six.

93
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:32,460
Woo-hoo!

94
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,827
And the second number
is three.

95
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:36,627
D'oh!

96
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,600
Yeah, I knew
we wouldn't win.

97
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:41,364
Well, why didn't you
tell the rest of us?

98
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:43,531
Why did you
keep it a secret!?

99
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:46,201
If you were 1 7,
we'd be rich.

100
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:50,542
<i>But no,
you had to be ten.</i>

101
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:53,811
And the final number is... 49.

102
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:55,977
38... 49!

103
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:58,487
Oh, my God. I won.

104
00:05:58,555 --> 00:05:59,579
I won!

105
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:06,494
Recapping our day's top story:

106
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:09,157
The winner of today's
state lottery is...

107
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,790
me, Kent Brockman.

108
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,165
Can we get a shot of me?

109
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:15,170
There you go.

110
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:17,035
In other news, uh...

111
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,371
a tragic mix-up
today in Cleveland.

112
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:22,139
Many people killed. Uh...

113
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,879
good-bye!

114
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,883
Oh, well,
we lost the money...

115
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,317
but we've still got
each other.

116
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:31,979
Hey, the dog's dead.

117
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:41,857
He's not dead.

118
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,561
Don't say the dog's dead
when he's not.

119
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,833
It's not fair
to toy with people's emotions.

120
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,238
<i>He is dead.
I'll get a shovel.</i>

121
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:53,402
Well, he's not dead,
but he is awfully sick.

122
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:56,675
Oh, sure,
the old man's off his rocker.

123
00:06:56,748 --> 00:07:00,411
<i>If Grandpa says he's dead,
he must be alive.</i>

124
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,747
He is alive.

125
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,310
He's wagging his tail.

126
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:06,414
Dogs wag their tails
for hours after they die.

127
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,618
I'm tired
of this conversation.

128
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:10,957
Let's talk
about something else.

129
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,291
I'm going home.

130
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,065
Clear.

131
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,798
Clear.

132
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,863
Doctor, he's gone.

133
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:27,401
This is the part
of the job I hate.

134
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:30,581
You did the best
you could.

135
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:31,910
I love animals.

136
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:35,350
I spend my life saving them,
and they can't thank me.

137
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,047
The parrots can, but--

138
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:40,648
Let's see what's wrong
with this little fellow.

139
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:43,883
Hmm.

140
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:47,363
I'm afraid your dog
has a twisted stomach.

141
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,229
He needs an operation
to correct it...

142
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,359
or he'll die.

143
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:53,165
How much
will it cost?

144
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:55,172
Seven hundred and fifty dollars.

145
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,105
Oh, dear.

146
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,769
This is never an easy decision.

147
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:02,711
Well, I guess
we'll have to talk it over.

148
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,771
What's there
to talk about?

149
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,976
What are we going
to talk over?

150
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:09,815
Mr. Teeny needs a refill
of his nicotine gum.

151
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,913
We're leaving the hospital.

152
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,823
When's the dog going to get
his operation?

153
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,418
Uh... later.
First I want to tell you...

154
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:20,589
about the most
wonderful place in the world--

155
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,496
doggie heaven.

156
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,127
In doggie heaven,
there's mountains of bones...

157
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:26,830
and you can't turn around...

158
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,339
without sniffing
another dog's butt.

159
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:31,238
All the best dogs
are there--

160
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,745
Old Yeller
and about eight Lassies--

161
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:35,972
Is there a doggie hell?

162
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:39,210
There couldn't be
a heaven without a hell.

163
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,046
Who's in there?

164
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,676
Oh... Hitler's dog...

165
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,984
and that dog Nixon had,
what's his name? Chester?

166
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,489
Checkers.

167
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,322
One of the Lassies
is in there too.

168
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:52,329
The mean one--
the one that mauled Timmy.

169
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:55,594
Does this have anything to do
with Santa's Little Helper?

170
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,795
Oh, honey,
$7 50 is a lot of money.

171
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,067
We really can't afford
this operation.

172
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,573
You'll let him die?

173
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,165
I know you're upset.

174
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,733
Darn right I'm upset!

175
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,041
Bart, watch your language.

176
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,910
Oh. You did. Sorry.

177
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:14,076
You're not going to let
our dog die, and that's it!

178
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:16,677
Lousy, dog-killing
son-of-a--

179
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,980
Well, it will be okay.

180
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,992
We'll get him
a new dog--

181
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,551
one with
an untwistable stomach.

182
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:31,829
Oh, come on. I'm sorry
but we just can't afford it.

183
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:35,568
Marge, make him stop.

184
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,073
Oh!

185
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,735
All right, all right,
we'll find a way.

186
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,006
Lousy, manipulative dog.

187
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,411
Uh, Mr. Burns...

188
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,971
I need to borrow money.

189
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,880
Please, do go on.

190
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,715
[ Homer]
I know you're a good man...

191
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:52,483
and I have a dog
that's very sick.

192
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:54,582
Oh, please, continue.

193
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,593
I thought maybe you--

194
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:58,253
Oh.

195
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,196
Well, thanks
for your time.

196
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:03,699
What makes a man
endanger his job...

197
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,931
<i>and even his life
by asking me for money?</i>

198
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:09,269
People like dogs,
Mr. Burns.

199
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,773
Dogs are idiots.

200
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:12,776
If I came into your house...

201
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:15,108
and started sniffing
at your crotch...

202
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,704
and slobbering
all over your face...

203
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,215
what would you say?

204
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:21,217
<i>If you did it, sir?</i>

205
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,617
Exactly.
You'd be fit to be tied.

206
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,121
Dogs!

207
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,622
Hmm.

208
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,352
No!

209
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:31,020
You are not performing
that operation yourself.

210
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:33,154
But, Marge, it looks so easy.

211
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:35,222
Just like carving a turkey.

212
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,290
Oh! Oh!

213
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,302
Eww!

214
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,134
Maybe you're right, Marge.

215
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:50,237
I found a way
we can pay for the operation.

216
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:51,338
All right!

217
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,508
Hear that, boy?

218
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,177
What do you got, Marge,
insurance scam?

219
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:56,686
We're just going...

220
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,949
to have to make
a few sacrifices.

221
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:02,925
Homer, you're going to have
to give up beer for a while.

222
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:06,157
Bart, you'll have to get
your hair cut for free...

223
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,095
at Springfield Barber College.

224
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,599
<i>No problemo.</i>

225
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,067
I'll give up
my weekly lottery ticket...

226
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,331
and I can stretch
the food budget.

227
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:17,169
Fried chicken night
will be organ meat night.

228
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,438
Ham night will be spam night,
and pork chop night...

229
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:22,371
will be chub night.

230
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,109
I don't even know what that is.

231
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:28,118
Lisa, I'm afraid
we'll have to stop getting...

232
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:31,451
<i>Encyclopedia Generica
from the grocery store.</i>

233
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,854
But next week is volume four--

234
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,324
Copernicus
through elephantiasis.

235
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,918
We all have
to make sacrifices, dear.

236
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:42,022
Maggie's baby clothes will have
to last for a little longer.

237
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,533
Marge, I've figured out...

238
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,536
an alternative
to giving up my beer.

239
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:50,199
Basically, we become a family
of traveling acrobats.

240
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:54,074
I don't think
you've thought this through.

241
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,715
Good news, Mr. Danielson.

242
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,251
We saved your gamecock...

243
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,753
but he'll never
fight again.

244
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,254
That's what you think.

245
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:07,188
He'll fight and he'll win.

246
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:12,089
Clamp.

247
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:15,660
Wipe.

248
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:18,463
No!

249
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:19,503
No!

250
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,097
<i>Come to the light, boy.</i>

251
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:26,302
<i>Come into the light.</i>

252
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:27,605
<i>Come on now.</i>

253
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:28,940
<i>There's a good boy.</i>

254
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,844
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

255
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:43,886
Um, Simpson?

256
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:49,457
Oh, Santa's Little Helper,
you're alive!

257
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:51,525
We were so worried
about you.

258
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:53,035
It's times like this...

259
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:55,470
I'm glad I flunked
out of dental school.

260
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,737
Lousy chub night.

261
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,334
Hey, how come...

262
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,345
he gets meat
and we don't?

263
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,347
You wouldn't want
what he's eating.

264
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,246
It's mostly
snouts and entrails.

265
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:09,650
Mmm... snouts.

266
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,085
Yes, I'm back.

267
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:13,453
Kent Brockman
is not the kind of man...

268
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:16,015
who would leave
a $500,000-a-year job...

269
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,492
because he won a lottery.

270
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:18,551
I'm a journalist.

271
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:21,257
He's got all the money
in the world...

272
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,800
but there's one thing
he can't buy.

273
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,426
What's that?

274
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,061
A dinosaur.

275
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:30,574
I'm not the only one benefiting
from last week's big payoff.

276
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:32,609
State schools got
their share too.

277
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:35,077
Here, lottery officials present
Springfield Elementary...

278
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:36,579
with a brand-new eraser.

279
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:37,705
One eraser?

280
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,012
I'm used to my government
betraying me.

281
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,415
I was in 'Nam.

282
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:42,918
I served for--

283
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,420
And speaking of lotteries...

284
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:48,686
here are the winning numbers
for this week's $40,000 jackpot.

285
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:52,525
3-6-1 7-1 8-22 and 29.

286
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:54,030
Oh, no!

287
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:55,531
Those are my numbers.

288
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,092
If it wasn't for that dog,
I would have won.

289
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,003
For tomorrow, I want you
to write a report...

290
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,007
on Copernicus.

291
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,337
D'oh!

292
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,138
Come on, booze hound.

293
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,145
You want the 25 cents?

294
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,441
Keep singing!

295
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,753
Who's that old rummy?

296
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,756
Before his dog got sick...

297
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:22,884
that old rummy used to be
my best customer.

298
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:28,358
Sing it, baby!

299
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,593
My quarter!

300
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:33,466
Okay, I'll just even
this out and--

301
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,568
Mr. Laswell...

302
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,233
I've done it again.

303
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,379
I know you can't understand me...

304
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:45,677
but you're a lousy dog
and I hate you.

305
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,445
Not now.

306
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:50,248
Can't you see I'm reading
a third-rate biography...

307
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:53,085
of Copernicus I found
at the bus station?

308
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:54,181
Dumb dog.

309
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,265
Homie, did you
close the gate?

310
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:04,266
Yes.

311
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,232
Oh, you mean tonight.

312
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,241
The dog will get out.

313
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,005
Bart, close the gate!

314
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,479
Oh, Lisa, close the gate!

315
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:20,517
Close the gate, Maggie!

316
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,134
Here, boy!

317
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,435
Here, Santa's Little Helper!

318
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:45,809
Oh...

319
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,814
it's all my fault.

320
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:50,009
I called him a dumb dog.

321
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:53,144
Oh, he's gone
and he's never coming back.

322
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,983
Wait! There he is!

323
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:57,183
No, that's a horse.

324
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,070
Have you found a picture yet?

325
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:53,079
Not one that
I want the public to see.

326
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:54,409
Mmm.

327
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:55,949
Oh.

328
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,142
Mmm.

329
00:16:57,218 --> 00:17:00,210
Oh, dear.

330
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,879
So, recycling...

331
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:04,789
is our way of giving
Mother Earth a big hug.

332
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,453
Yes, well,
it does sound like fun.

333
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,827
I can't wait to start pawing
through my garbage...

334
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:12,923
like some
starving raccoon.

335
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,729
Release the hounds.

336
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:15,632
Well, neighbor...

337
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,967
I see you've got
your running shoes on.

338
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,232
That's a good thing.

339
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,975
What's wrong
with Crippler?

340
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,983
He's getting on, sir.

341
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,519
He's been here
since the late '60s.

342
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:37,387
I'll never forget the day
he bagged his first hippie.

343
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,950
<i>That young man didn't think
it was too groovy.</i>

344
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,256
I'm looking for something...

345
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,492
in an attack dog--
one who likes...

346
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,127
the sweet, gamey tang
of human flesh.

347
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:51,671
Why, here's the fellow.

348
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,970
Wiry, fast, firm,
proud buttocks.

349
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,805
Reminds me of me.

350
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,313
Ah, the last one.

351
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:11,990
D'oh!

352
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,526
As an attack dog...

353
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,620
you'll be expected
to neutralize intruders.

354
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,494
Want to buy some cookies?

355
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:22,701
If that was
a Girl Scout...

356
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,567
I'd have been bothered
by now.

357
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,265
I know how you feel.

358
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,638
I lost my dog too.

359
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,768
He's in here somewhere.

360
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:43,054
<i>[ ''Ode toJoy''from Beethoven's
Symphony No. 9 playing ]</i>

361
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,793
Poor Santa's Little Helper.

362
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:57,634
I'm starting to think
we'll never see him again.

363
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,195
That was his dish...

364
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:01,537
and that was his leash...

365
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,806
and that's where
he took a whiz on the rug.

366
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,907
Homer, get a hold
of yourself.

367
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:12,544
Even if he has passed on,
there's no reason to cry.

368
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,713
Remember? Doggie heaven?

369
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:15,948
Oh, Marge!

370
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:17,991
There is no such place.

371
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,652
Or...

372
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:23,162
to put it another way...

373
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,492
there is.

374
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,827
I'm not giving up.

375
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,301
If I have to knock on every door
in this two-bit town...

376
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,031
I'm going to find my dog.

377
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,096
And I'll be right here
watching TV.

378
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,902
Poka, poka, poka.

379
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,676
Poka, poka, poka.

380
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,414
Excellent.

381
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:49,146
Hello. I'm Kent Brockman.

382
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:50,520
Excuse me, sir.

383
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:51,649
I lost my dog.

384
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,920
And you want me
to buy you a new one.

385
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,359
Since I won the lottery...

386
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:57,897
everybody wants a piece
of Kent Brockman--

387
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,796
homeless this and hungry that.

388
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,767
Gee, I'm sorry, mister.

389
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:04,702
Sir, your llama
just bit Ted Kennedy.

390
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,000
Good!

391
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:14,003
I hate to interrupt
your longevity treatment, sir...

392
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:16,811
but there's a sweet little boy
at the door.

393
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,511
Release the hounds.

394
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,453
Santa's Little Helper!
It's you!

395
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:36,034
What's the matter, boy?

396
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:37,297
I'm your buddy.

397
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:42,537
I love you, boy.

398
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:11,236
Let me pet him again.

399
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,432
You already petted him
for ten minutes.

400
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,270
I want to pet him again.

401
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:16,866
You can pet the cat.

402
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,878
The cat?
What's the point?

403
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,971
Good boy,
Santa's Little Helper.

404
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:21,980
Oh, good boy.

405
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,949
This will never happen again.

406
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,986
You can have anything
you want.

407
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:29,352
You can sleep on my bed,
you can chew on slippers.

408
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,084
Yeah, he's
a good doggie.

409
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:40,190
Shh!
