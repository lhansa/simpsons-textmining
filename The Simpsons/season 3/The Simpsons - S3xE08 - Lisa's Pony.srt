1
00:00:02,397 --> 00:00:07,300
##Ahhh, the Simpsons ##

2
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:38,990
D'oh!

3
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:22,589
Ooh!

4
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:37,140
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what?
Hello?

5
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,039
Dad, the school talent show--

6
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,668
I know, it's tonight.

7
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:43,441
I broke my last saxophone reed.

8
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:45,107
I need a new one.

9
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:48,243
Isn't this something
your mother's better at?

10
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,082
I called her.
She's not home.

11
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:54,454
I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty,
Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy...

12
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:57,427
and that nice man who caught
the snake in our basement.

13
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:58,757
Wow. And after them...

14
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,424
out of all the people in the world...

15
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:02,557
you chose me.

16
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:03,726
Uh-huh.

17
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:06,133
Number 4½/ reed. Got it.

18
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,934
You're in for
a whale of a show tonight.

19
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:13,103
The doors are now locked,
so you parents can't sneak out...

20
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:15,475
after your own child has performed.

21
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:18,448
Let me caution the people
in the first five rows--

22
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:20,711
<i>You will get wet.</i>

23
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,521
Just in the nick of--

24
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:28,616
Mmm. Beer.

25
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,762
I've only got five minutes
till the music store closes.

26
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:35,025
Go there first.

27
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,033
Do I tell you what to do?

28
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,125
Sorry, Homer.

29
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:39,931
Tip the glass.

30
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,801
Sorry, Homer.

31
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:49,303
This is a whole lot of nothing.

32
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,371
I'd rather watch the boilers.

33
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,543
Make sure you return
those chairs to the cafeteria.

34
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:55,881
I'm not kidding.

35
00:02:55,954 --> 00:03:00,618
Ah... finished,
with 1 5 seconds to spare.

36
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,860
Ah!

37
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:07,090
D'oh! D'oh!
D'oh! D'oh!

38
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,928
What's the matter, buddy?

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,195
The moron next door closed early.

40
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,567
<i>I happen to be that moron.</i>

41
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:16,300
Oh, me and my
trenchant mouth!

42
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:24,110
Oh, terrible,just terrible.

43
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:26,446
They seem to get worse every year.

44
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:27,609
Ha, ha, ha!

45
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:28,743
Wonderful!

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,448
This is the best batch
we've ever had.

47
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:33,581
And now, here's Bart Simpson...

48
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:36,718
the boy of a thousand voices.

49
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,465
I'd like to open
with my impression of...

50
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:43,056
Principal Skinner.

51
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:48,971
Duh, look at me.

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,302
I'm Principal Skinner.

53
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:53,676
That young man just became...

54
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:56,009
the boy of a thousand days detention.

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,413
I wonder what lunch lady Doris
has for us today.

56
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:02,351
Today's special is refried...

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,614
dog poop.

58
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:10,390
Please! You've got
to open that store.

59
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:12,088
Let me think about it.

60
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,755
Uh... no.

61
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:16,766
Okay, but I want you
to see a picture...

62
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,769
of the little girl
you're disappointing.

63
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,498
Well, I don't have one.

64
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:22,596
Come on,Jer.

65
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:23,766
Open up.

66
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:26,503
I pulled you
out of that burning car.

67
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:28,670
Okay, but now we're even.

68
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,680
What does your daughter need?

69
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:32,079
I wrote it down.

70
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,744
''Number... Number 4½/--''

71
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:36,081
Stupid gum!

72
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,746
''Number 4½/ reed.''

73
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:39,084
Whoo-hoo!

74
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:41,751
Mm-hmm. What instrument
does she play?

75
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:44,021
I don't know.

76
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,758
Mom, where is he?

77
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:52,769
If I don't get that reed,
I'll sound terrible.

78
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,099
Don't worry, honey.

79
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:56,265
I'm sure your father is...

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,070
<i>maybe--</i>

81
00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:00,940
<i>No.</i>

82
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:03,606
<i>That's a long shot.</i>

83
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,273
<i>Bingo.</i>

84
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:06,941
Don't worry.

85
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:08,451
He'll be here.

86
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,850
- Clarinet? Oboe?
- No.

87
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,183
- Saxophone?
- No.

88
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,552
What was that last one?

89
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:13,521
Saxophone.

90
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:14,558
Hmm...

91
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,183
Lisa, stop playing that stupid--

92
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,852
Saxophone! That's it!

93
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:18,759
Alto or tenor?

94
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,558
D'oh!

95
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:27,265
This act is over!

96
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:28,930
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

97
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:31,600
I'd like to put this filth behind us...

98
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:32,938
and let's all enjoy...

99
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,069
Lisa Simpson's rendition...

100
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,273
of''Stormy Leather.''

101
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,009
Uh, ''Weather.''

102
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:54,792
Sounds like that gopher
I caught in me lawn mower.

103
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:03,202
Ew, I'd hate to be
that kid's father.

104
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:06,307
Uh-oh.

105
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:09,975
That will do.

106
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:11,480
It's not my fault.

107
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:12,811
It's the reed.

108
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,317
Oh, yes, of course.

109
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:15,875
It's the reed.

110
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:18,387
Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson...

111
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:19,980
and her wacky sax.

112
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,991
Yeah!

113
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:22,991
Whoo!

114
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,789
Must be her father.

115
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:26,124
Whoo, yeah...

116
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,558
Who ordered a Mount Bellyache?

117
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,290
I ordered it for my little girl.

118
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,660
I'm done.

119
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,225
Oh! That cost $88!

120
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,897
I don't feel much like eating.

121
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,532
Look, I let you down
and I apologize.

122
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,076
I know that doesn't make it right.

123
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,374
I hope you can forgive me.

124
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,743
I forgive you.

125
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,044
D'oh! You didn't mean that.

126
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,550
No, I didn't.

127
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,386
Look, Homer...

128
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,395
Lisa's taking her first steps.

129
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,555
You're taping it?

130
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,563
Yes.

131
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,065
I'll watch it later.

132
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,726
The plane,
the plane!

133
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,032
No, my freakish little friend.

134
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,298
Hmm.

135
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,906
Da-da.

136
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,408
Da-da.

137
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,410
Did you hear that, Homer?

138
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,378
Marge, please-- I'm busy.

139
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,915
No wonder she hates me.

140
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,919
Oh, I never even noticed
she was alive.

141
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,080
If you want to make up with Lisa...

142
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,817
spend some time with her.

143
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,325
Ohh! Okay!

144
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,930
Ahh!

145
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,711
Maybe I should give up on Lisa...

146
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,181
and make a fresh start
with Maggie.

147
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,309
Stop looking for the quick fix.

148
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,719
If you keep spending time
with Lisa, she'll forgive you.

149
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,758
If I spend any more time
doing girl things...

150
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,090
I'm going to, you know, go fruity.

151
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,425
No, you were right the first time...

152
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,089
with that quick fix idea.

153
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,224
Let's see-- quick fix, quick fix.

154
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,964
I'll buy her that pony
she's always bugging me for.

155
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,665
We can't afford it.

156
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,867
With today's gasoline prices,
we can't afford not to.

157
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:30,932
Ridiculous.

158
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,944
When I look in Lisa's eyes...

159
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,604
I don't see love.

160
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,945
That's no reason to buy a pony.

161
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,417
When you yell at me,
I see love in your eyes.

162
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,749
Stick to the subject.

163
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,413
# Uh-huh
you love me #

164
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,752
Let's be realistic.

165
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,086
A pony is expensive.

166
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,287
We have enough trouble
paying bills as it is.

167
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,624
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,029
Promise me you won't buy a pony.

169
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,031
Hmm.

170
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,432
Was that a yes or a no?

171
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,435
Baa.

172
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,062
Those aren't even words.

173
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,070
Sna.

174
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,803
Oh, my, what's that smell?

175
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,371
Oh, it's you.

176
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,677
Excuse me.

177
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,910
Do you sell ponies?

178
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,919
Sure, pal. Right here.

179
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,722
''Scottish Deer Hound.''

180
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,519
Hey, this is a dog!

181
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,891
My friend, you're smarter
than I gave you credit for.

182
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,329
I suggest you try the pony farm
on Route 401 .

183
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,163
Merely take a left
at the rendering plant.

184
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,942
Lady, I'm buying a pony
for my little girl...

185
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,341
and I don't care what it costs.

186
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,471
Very good.
That stunning creature over there...

187
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,209
is half a million dollars.

188
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,944
Half a million dollars?!

189
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,781
He was sired by Seattle Slew.

190
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,684
His mother won
the Kentucky Derby.

191
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,986
His likeness
graces a stamp in Tanzania.

192
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:52,922
Sold.

193
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,926
Mr. Simpson, do you have...

194
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,928
half a million dollars?

195
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,295
Sure, let me write you a check.

196
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,865
Mr. Simpson...

197
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,840
this check is dated
January 1 , 2054.

198
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,842
Is there a problem with that?

199
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,277
Our ponies start at $5,000... cash.

200
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,611
Isn't there like a pound...

201
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,948
where you can pick up cheap ponies...

202
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,748
that ran away from home?

203
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,288
I sincerely hope not.

204
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,658
I'd like...

205
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,318
to borrow $5,000.

206
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,622
Sorry.

207
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,460
I can't approve
a loan that size myself.

208
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,624
Hello.

209
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,132
''Simpson.''

210
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,897
How can I help you?

211
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,030
Mr. Burns,
you do this personally?

212
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,232
It's a hobby.

213
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,571
I'm not in this for personal gain.

214
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,272
Are you acquainted with our
state's stringent usury laws?

215
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,279
Usury?

216
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,337
Silly me.

217
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,246
I made up a word
that doesn't exist.

218
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,444
What is the purpose of this loan?

219
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,282
I want to buy a pony.

220
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,413
Isn't that cute?

221
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,390
He's planning on joining
the horsey set.

222
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,051
That is it, isn't it?

223
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,186
You're not planning to eat it?

224
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,197
It's for my little girl
because she doesn't love me.

225
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,527
Shut up, Simpson.

226
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,363
You have any collateral?

227
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,699
Smithers, let's not be so cold.

228
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,138
His spirit is my collateral.

229
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,541
Just sign this form
and the money will be yours.

230
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,437
Sorry, I was just thinking...

231
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,109
of something funny
Smithers did today.

232
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,209
I didn't do anything funny, sir.

233
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,685
Shut up.

234
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,947
Mr. Simpson...

235
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:36,291
are you quite sure you know
how to take care of a pony?

236
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,829
Of course.

237
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:42,391
Simpson, you've done it again.

238
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,184
Oh!

239
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,486
I love you, Dad!

240
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,687
Mmmmm.

241
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,922
I am very upset with you.

242
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,760
Sounds like someone's angling...

243
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,766
for a pony of her own.

244
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,933
How come Lisa gets a pony?

245
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,267
She stopped loving me.

246
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,364
So get me a moped.

247
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:26,435
I know you love me,
so you don't get squat.

248
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,946
Snowball II,
Santa's Little Helper--

249
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,607
This is Princess.

250
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,777
Please don't exclude her
because she's different.

251
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,815
Where were you planning
to keep this horse?

252
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,450
I've got it figured out.

253
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,462
By day, it will roam free
around the neighborhood...

254
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,691
and at night,
it will nestle snugly...

255
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,791
between the cars in our garage.

256
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,130
Dad, no!

257
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,295
That's illegal.

258
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,565
That's for the courts to decide.

259
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,072
Marge, she loves me.

260
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,736
Dad, I think Princess
belongs in a stable.

261
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,743
Stable?

262
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,404
That sounds expensive.

263
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,881
This is what love costs a month?

264
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,078
These are standard fees, Mr. Simpson.

265
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,247
Plus, I'm teaching your daughter
riding, grooming...

266
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,258
and at no extra charge,
pronunciation.

267
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,591
You've made me
the happiest girl who ever lived.

268
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,433
Oh, nuts.

269
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,693
What do I do? What do I do?

270
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,135
If you want to go right...

271
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,296
move the joystick left.

272
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,771
Yes. Move the--

273
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,535
What's a joystick?

274
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:31,009
Oh, oh!
Here comes a Xylon cruiser!

275
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,636
Go into hyperspace!

276
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,238
Wait! Where's the hyperspace?

277
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,646
Grandpa, you're the spaceship.

278
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,742
I thought I was this guy.

279
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:41,487
- Oh!
- Oh!

280
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,647
Game's over.

281
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,817
I got down on the floor for this?!

282
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:46,825
Wait, Dad.

283
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,987
I've got something for you.

284
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,364
I was hoping...

285
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:52,922
it would be money.

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,060
Hmm, dear. We're
in serious trouble here.

287
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,833
We're just going to have
to cut down on luxuries.

288
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,273
Well, we're always buying Maggie...

289
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,971
vaccinations for diseases
she doesn't even have.

290
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,843
We could cut down on beer.

291
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,712
We're not going to do that.

292
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,775
Then there's no choice
but to give up the pony.

293
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,946
First you didn't
want the pony.

294
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,115
Now you want me
to take it back.

295
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,351
Make up your mind.

296
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,357
Homer!

297
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,326
Lisa loves me.
The pony stays.

298
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,226
You got us into this.

299
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,628
You get us out.

300
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,791
There's plenty of money out there...

301
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,994
for a guy who's willing to work.

302
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,697
Do you have any jewelry
you don't need?

303
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,205
Mmmmm.

304
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,538
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

305
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,704
Oh, you haven't touched
your salt lick.

306
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,543
Num-num. Good salt lick.

307
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:49,014
Need money. Need money.

308
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,647
One scratch-for-cash.

309
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,656
Here you go.

310
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,090
Liberty bell.

311
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,151
Two liberty bells.

312
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,322
Come on,
come on, come on--

313
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,489
Oh.

314
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,759
Yes!

315
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,822
Whoo-whoo!

316
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,664
Three liberty bells!

317
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,000
That will be $1 0,000, Apu.

318
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,937
Congratulations, Mr. Homer.

319
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,939
Thank you.

320
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,771
If I could see the ticket--

321
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:10,832
There it is.

322
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,277
Please to be removing your thumb.

323
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:14,279
No.

324
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,145
Yes, please. I must insist.

325
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,148
No. No.

326
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,149
You can't see--

327
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,150
Yes, I must--

328
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,151
No! Let go!

329
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,450
You're ripping it.

330
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,785
A cherry.

331
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,450
Oh, Mr. Homer...

332
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:29,792
what has reduced you
to such cheap chicanery?

333
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,296
Oh... I need money.

334
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,696
If you need money...

335
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,633
you should have
jammed a gun in my ribs...

336
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,694
or inquire
about my help wanted sign.

337
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,704
You need help?

338
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,172
Someone for the demanding...

339
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,709
high profile
midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift.

340
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,971
I'm your man.

341
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,637
You're hired.

342
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,146
I dreamed of the day...

343
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,115
one of you would work for me.

344
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,753
She certainly tamed that horse.

345
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:58,815
But what man can tame her?

346
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,325
<i>I won't lie to you.</i>

347
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,521
<i>On this job,
you will be shot at.</i>

348
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,156
Each bullet wound
is a badge of honor.

349
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,665
''Badge of honor''--

350
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,166
Here's a pointer.

351
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,169
Try taking it in the shoulder.

352
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:13,229
These hot dogs have been here
for three years.

353
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,968
They are strictly ornamental.

354
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,876
There is only one bozo
who comes in and buys them.

355
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,675
But I eat-- Oh.

356
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,813
The perfect crime.

357
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:29,822
Homer, where have you been
all night?

358
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,118
I was so worried.

359
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,125
Let's go in the other room.

360
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,127
I did something I'm ashamed of.

361
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,856
The kids can't hear it.

362
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,625
Busted.

363
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,166
I'll work midnight to 8:00.

364
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:41,667
Come home, sleep five minutes...

365
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,430
eat breakfast,
sleep six minutes, shower.

366
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,801
I have ten minutes
to bask in Lisa's love...

367
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:48,603
Then I'm off to the power plant,
fresh as a daisy.

368
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,644
Oh, my God, she killed him.

369
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,751
Mmm. Salty.

370
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,619
Homer!

371
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,954
Are you stealing Squishies?

372
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:06,958
No, sir.

373
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,621
This next song is also...

374
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,687
about a girl and her pony.

375
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:15,929
It's called ''Wildfire.''

376
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:23,537
Come on, Apu, honey, loosen up.

377
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,168
Ohh!

378
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,610
I'm sorry, baby.

379
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,443
While I'm here with you...

380
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,245
my store is going down the tubes.

381
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:40,927
Three dollars
and 51 ... 52... 53 cents.

382
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,758
Homer, you are asleep
at your post!

383
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,229
Go change the expiration dates...

384
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,596
on the dairy products.

385
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:47,599
Yes, sir.

386
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:50,102
Sorry, baby. Date's over.

387
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:51,297
Homie, how long do you
plan to do this?

388
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:52,457
I don't know.

389
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:53,965
How long do horses live?

390
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,296
30 years.

391
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,631
D'oh.

392
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,136
<i>Mustn't sleep.</i>

393
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,604
<i>Must monitor core.</i>

394
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:05,606
Hello?

395
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,806
I called to say I love you.

396
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,007
Thanks.

397
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,710
When is she going
to stop loving me?

398
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,814
I heard Milli Vanilli was arrested...

399
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,948
for impersonating a McNugget.

400
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:21,324
Well, it's still fun to be up late.

401
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,919
Hey, Homer, where you going?

402
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,293
Going for...

403
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,424
eight-hour walk.

404
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,530
Homer. Homer.

405
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,973
Homer sleep now.

406
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:38,341
What's wrong with Dad?

407
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,403
He's just exhausted.

408
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,745
Lisa, do you know what
it costs to keep a pony?

409
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:44,806
No.

410
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:46,250
Well, it's a lot.

411
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,651
Your father had
to take a second job.

412
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:49,654
Poor guy.

413
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,054
Where's he working?

414
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,113
The Kwik-E mart.

415
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,192
I hope you realize...

416
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,629
that your father can't keep this up.

417
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,461
You're making me
give up Princess?

418
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,126
We can't make you.

419
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,635
I can make her.

420
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,228
Give me five minutes
alone with her.

421
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,295
No, Bart.

422
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,636
No one's making her.

423
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,801
Lisa has to decide for herself.

424
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,369
All the years I've lobbied
to be treated like an adult...

425
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:16,177
have blown up in my face.

426
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,150
Hey!

427
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,151
When I ordered...

428
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,347
that blueberry Squishy,
I meant today.

429
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,912
Coming right up, sir.

430
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,356
And fill it to the top time.

431
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,552
Yes, sir.

432
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,797
She likes a little carrot
after her oats...

433
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,332
and she likes it...

434
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,732
when you scratch her
behind the ear.

435
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:39,329
She likes contemporary
adult radio in the morning...

436
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,237
and easy listening at night.

437
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,742
Please take good care
of my Princess.

438
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,075
Although there is no change
in my patrician facade...

439
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,206
my heart is breaking.

440
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,419
I'll never forget you.

441
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:54,681
What the?

442
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,246
You call this melted cheese
receptacle clean?

443
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:02,091
The young man you replaced
is rolling over in his grave.

444
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,424
You don't have to do this.

445
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,429
Yes, I do.

446
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:05,931
You see, Lisa...

447
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,194
grown-ups have
a thing called money.

448
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,203
Dad, I understand the sacrifice
you've made for me.

449
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,603
That's why I gave up the pony.

450
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,503
You did?

451
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:15,871
There's a big dumb animal...

452
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,103
I love more than that horse.

453
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,578
What is it, a hippopotamus?

454
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,638
I mean you, you dummy.

455
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,206
Oh.

456
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:29,847
Apu, you can take this job
and restaff it.

457
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,218
Giddy-up, Dad!

458
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,087
He slept, he stole...

459
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,099
he was rude to the customers.

460
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,534
Still, there goes
the best damned employee...

461
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,503
a convenience store ever had.

462
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:54,525
Shh!
