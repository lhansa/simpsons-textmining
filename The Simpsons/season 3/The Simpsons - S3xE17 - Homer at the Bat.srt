1
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:07,320
<i>##Ahh, the Simpsons ##</i>

2
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:38,995
D'oh!

3
00:00:57,404 --> 00:01:00,237
Mmm, doughnuts.

4
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:05,701
Hey, Homer, slow down.

5
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:07,440
You're going to choke
or something.

6
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:10,108
Don't tell me
how to eat doughnuts.

7
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,448
Hey, Homer's choking again.

8
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,284
Isn't there a first aid
chart around here somewhere?

9
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:18,586
- Somebody scare him.
- That's for the hiccups.

10
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,527
Hey, look at this.

11
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,655
Softball starts this week.

12
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,221
Softball?

13
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,427
Who's next?

14
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,231
- Count me out.
- Not me.
- No way.

15
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,737
What's the matter with you guys?

16
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:34,069
Last year we were 2 and 28.

17
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,608
It wasn't our best season.

18
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:36,768
Actually, it was.

19
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:38,003
This year it's
gonna be different.

20
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,171
What makes you so damn sure?

21
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,545
<i>I have a secret weapon.</i>

22
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:45,483
Hey, he's been holding out
on us, huh?

23
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:46,917
A secret weapon?

24
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:49,455
I wonder what it could be.

25
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,229
Hmm.

26
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,594
- Count me in.
- I'm there.

27
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,104
<i>Come here, boy.
I want to show you something.</i>

28
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,868
What's that?
A homemade bat?

29
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,374
It's something very special--

30
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:11,138
a homemade bat.

31
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:13,202
It all started last year...

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,679
<i>during a terrible thunderstorm...</i>

33
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:16,375
<i>when I locked myself...</i>

34
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,145
<i>out of the house.</i>

35
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:21,051
<i>Sheltering myself with
a large piece of sheet metal...</i>

36
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:24,557
<i>I ran for cover under
the tallest tree I could find.</i>

37
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:30,328
<i>Something told me
this was a very special...</i>

38
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:34,595
<i>very magical piece of wood
that I could make a bat out of.</i>

39
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,603
<i>I put my homemade football on hold...</i>

40
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,300
<i>and set to work making
the world's greatest bat.</i>

41
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,410
Homie, come to bed.

42
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:56,011
Homer, go back to the garage.

43
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:58,614
And here it is.

44
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,162
Wow! How many home runs...

45
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,198
you going to hit with that?

46
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,757
We play 30 games,
1 0 at bats a game-- 3,000.

47
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:17,709
Hit one here, Charlie!

48
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,515
Let's go over the ground rules.

49
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:25,073
You can't leave first
until you chug a beer.

50
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:26,915
Any man scoring
has to chug a beer.

51
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:29,455
Chug a beer at the top
of all odd-numbered innings.

52
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,457
And the fourth inning
is the beer inning.

53
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,288
Hey, we know
how to play softball.

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,225
Play ball!

55
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:38,321
<i>Attention all units!
Attention all units!</i>

56
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,525
<i>Armored car being robbed
at Fifth and Main.</i>

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,830
Turn off that damn radio!

58
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:45,337
<i>And the next man
wants to hit the ball too.</i>

59
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:48,135
And there he goes
off in that direction.

60
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,766
And everyone is happy.

61
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:52,539
Mom, why don't you
let me call the game?

62
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:55,137
That's all right, dear.
I can do it.

63
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:01,817
Men, stop that!

64
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:06,256
Okay, Homer, bases loaded,
and you're up.

65
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:07,759
Where's that secret weapon?

66
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,352
Check it out, boys.

67
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,056
My magic bat.

68
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:12,291
That's it?

69
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:14,629
Yeah, I got a magic bat too.

70
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:17,192
And I got
an enchanted jockstrap.

71
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,033
Yeah.Just watch.

72
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:36,221
Whoo-hoo!

73
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:38,948
All right, Homeboy!

74
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,322
Yeah!

75
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:42,623
Ha-ha! Cops can't win!

76
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,891
- Get his license and registration.
- Right, Chief.

77
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:50,763
Wow, Dad.

78
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:52,668
Homer, can I get you a beer?

79
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:55,207
No. I want to get him a beer.

80
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:58,210
Kids, kids,
you can each get me a beer.

81
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:01,679
But first, let's see it again
in super slow motion.

82
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:07,282
Why, you--

83
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:08,582
Huh?

84
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,561
Ooh!

85
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,038
Such a mighty wallop.

86
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,979
I got my magic bat off a piano.

87
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,572
My sister let me use
her wooden leg.

88
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,019
<i>Good news, sir.</i>

89
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:46,524
The softball team won again.

90
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,027
If we beat Shelbyville,
we capture the pennant.

91
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,528
Did you hear that, Ari?

92
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:53,794
My boys need only to thump your tub,
and the title is ours.

93
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:54,891
Ha!

94
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,129
The Gladiators
from my power plant...

95
00:05:57,204 --> 00:06:00,002
will crush your team
like nine flabby grapes.

96
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:01,665
I disagree.

97
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:04,266
Would you care to bet
a million dollars?

98
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,335
Why don't we make it interesting?

99
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,574
What, a million dollars
isn't interesting?

100
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:09,580
Did you say a million?

101
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,139
I'm sorry.
My mind was elsewhere.

102
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:13,152
I thought you would start
with a small amount...

103
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,188
we would bait each other and--

104
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:16,244
<i>You know how it goes.</i>

105
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:19,319
Certainly.
A million will be fine.

106
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:23,155
Smithers, I've been thinking.

107
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:25,919
Is it wrong to cheat
to win a million dollar bet?

108
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:26,925
Yes, sir.

109
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:28,359
Let me rephrase that.

110
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,990
<i>Is it wrong if I cheat
to win a million dollar bet?</i>

111
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,226
No, sir.
Who would you like killed?

112
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:35,359
No, Smithers.

113
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,769
I've decided
to bring in a few ringers--

114
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,931
professional baseballers.

115
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,441
We'll give them
token jobs at the plant...

116
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,000
and have them play
on our softball team.

117
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:46,568
Honus Wagner, Cap Anson...

118
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:47,841
Mordecai Brown--

119
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:49,177
<i>Uh, sir.</i>

120
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,910
What is it, Smithers?

121
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:53,919
I'm afraid all those players
have retired...

122
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,614
and, uh, passed on.

123
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:59,625
In fact, your right fielder
has been dead for 1 30 years.

124
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:00,853
Damnation!

125
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:03,260
Find me some good players--
living players.

126
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,922
Scour the professional ranks--

127
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:07,330
the American League,
the National League...

128
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:08,663
the Negro leagues.

129
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:09,599
I'm on my way.

130
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,932
Oh, and, Smithers...

131
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,438
you have 2 4 hours.

132
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,774
I get $50,000 to play one game?

133
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:22,281
That's right, Mr. Canseco.

134
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:24,840
It's a pay cut,
but what the hey.

135
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:26,351
It sounds like fun.

136
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,978
Uh... oh--

137
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:30,555
Hey, sorry.

138
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,182
I thought you were a deer.

139
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,191
Oh, that's okay.

140
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,693
Happens all the time.

141
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,353
Are you Mike Scioscia?

142
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,522
That's me.

143
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,066
How do you like working
for the Dodgers?

144
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,395
It's okay...

145
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:44,198
but sometimes I wish I had
something more blue collar...

146
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:46,865
with big machines
and cool dials and stuff...

147
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,373
like an oil refinery...

148
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:49,841
or hydroelectric plant.

149
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,104
We should talk.

150
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:53,772
<i>And this is Elvis'rec room.</i>

151
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,338
When the King wasn't
rehearsing or exercising...

152
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,852
he liked to unwind by watching
up to three TVs at once.

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,184
Man, oh, man, what a lifestyle.

154
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:03,689
Are you Ozzie Smith?

155
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:04,689
Yes.

156
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,225
I have a proposition for you.

157
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:10,928
- Hello. Are you Don Mattingly?

158
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,296
Yes. Yes, I am.
Come in. Come in.

159
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,961
Can I get you something?
What's your name?

160
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:20,206
How would you
like to be a ringer...

161
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:22,435
on a small-town
company softball team?

162
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,636
Would I?

163
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,269
Now I'd like to introduce...

164
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:28,940
the new members of our
happy power plant family.

165
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,950
<i>- Our security guard, Roger Clemens.
- Hello.</i>

166
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:32,952
<i>- Ourjanitor, Wade Boggs.
- How you doing?</i>

167
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,046
<i>- Our lunchroom cashier, Ken GriffeyJr.
- Hey, what's up, guys?</i>

168
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:37,556
Our new, well, uh...

169
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:40,058
we'll make up jobs
for these fellas later.

170
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:43,062
<i>Say hello to Steve Sax,
Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry...</i>

171
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,621
<i>Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia
andJose Canseco.</i>

172
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,394
- Ooh.
- Wow.
- Geez.

173
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,129
By the way, you new fellas,
there's a sign-up sheet...

174
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:53,229
for the softball team
on the board over there...

175
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:54,968
just in case you wish to play.

176
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,942
- Wait a minute.
- What's going on?

177
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,171
With them on the team,
you won't need us.

178
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:01,908
<i>Well, duh.
You, Scioscia, sign up.</i>

179
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:05,349
I'm here to run the solid
contaminate encapsulator.

180
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,013
One more outburst, and I'll
send you back to the big leagues.

181
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:12,791
- You're Darryl Strawberry.
- Yes.

182
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,520
- You play right field.
- Yes.

183
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,460
- I play right field too.
- So?

184
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,588
Are you better than me?

185
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:20,861
Well, I've never met you,
but... yes.

186
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:24,529
It's not fair. We worked so hard
to get to the championship game...

187
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,800
and we'll be sitting on the bench.

188
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:28,602
You hit so many home runs.

189
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:29,869
What makes you think...

190
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,207
this Darryl Strawberry
is better than you?

191
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,541
Marge, forget it.

192
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,583
He's bigger than me,
faster, stronger...

193
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,551
and he already has more friends
around the plant than I do.

194
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,315
You make me sick, Homer.

195
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:45,222
You're the one who told me I could
do anything if I put my mind to it.

196
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,819
Now that you're older,
I can tell you that's a crock.

197
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,829
No matter how good you are...

198
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:52,831
there's always
a million people better.

199
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,833
Gotcha--
Can't win, don't try.

200
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:58,166
As your new manager,
I want to say this up front--

201
00:09:58,238 --> 00:10:00,399
No one is assured a spot
in the starting lineup.

202
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,408
I don't care
if you're Steve Sax...

203
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,841
or Darryl Strawberry or--

204
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,844
What's one
of the bad players' names?

205
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:07,004
Homer Simpson, sir.

206
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,513
<i>Or Homer Simpson.</i>

207
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:11,517
Secondly, instead of beer,
you will all drink this.

208
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:12,847
It's a brain and nerve tonic...

209
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,353
rich in proteins and
electromagnetic juices.

210
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:17,356
It promotes robust health.

211
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:19,790
It has been known
to cause gigantism...

212
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,521
but only in rare cases.

213
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:23,187
Try some.

214
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:25,731
It's like there's
a party in my mouth...

215
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,061
and everyone's invited.

216
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:28,226
Excellent.

217
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:30,826
Let's begin our training,
shall we?

218
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,132
Smithers...

219
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:33,832
the medicine balls.

220
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,205
Ugh.

221
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,540
Ugh.

222
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:43,875
Here.

223
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,094
What are you gonna do
with your million dollars?

224
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:57,596
Throw it in the pile,
I suppose.

225
00:10:57,664 --> 00:11:00,929
You are all very good players.

226
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,935
We are all very good players.

227
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:05,335
You will beat Shelbyville.

228
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:07,430
We will beat Shelbyville.

229
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:10,601
You will give 1 1 0%.

230
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:11,837
That's impossible.

231
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:14,938
No one can give more than 1 00%.

232
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:18,951
By definition, that is
the most anyone can give.

233
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:21,285
I got it!

234
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:22,286
I got it!

235
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,220
Yes.

236
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,555
Hey!

237
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,889
I called for that.

238
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,395
Put a lid on it.

239
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:32,398
There's no ''I'' in ''team.''

240
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:35,435
Some of these guys
have a bad attitude, Skip.

241
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:36,992
They sure do, Strawberry.

242
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:41,439
Scioscia, I don't get it.

243
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:43,942
You're a ringer,
but you're here every night...

244
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,137
busting your butt
hauling radioactive waste.

245
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,147
It's a relief
from the pressures...

246
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:49,739
of playing big league ball.

247
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:52,284
There, you make
any mistake, and boom--

248
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,513
the press is all over you.

249
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,486
Uh-oh.

250
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:56,817
Don't worry about it.

251
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,256
Oh, man, is this ever sweet.

252
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:00,258
Me, me.

253
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,259
Pick me.

254
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:02,761
Pick me, pick me.

255
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,592
I pick Ken GriffeyJr.

256
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:05,892
Aw, geez.

257
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:08,594
Okay, I'll take Millhouse.

258
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:11,660
<i>Mr. Boggs,
will you be on my team?</i>

259
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,103
You got yourself a player.

260
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:14,606
Damn!

261
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,608
All right, I'll take Louis.

262
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,109
<i>I'll takeJose Canseco.</i>

263
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:19,440
D'oh!

264
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:22,448
Mattingly,
get rid of those sideburns.

265
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:23,448
What sideburns?

266
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:24,950
You heard me, hippie.

267
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,952
These guys aren't so tough.

268
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,113
I've got Wonderbat.

269
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,061
Take a knee, boys.

270
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,292
Tomorrow is the biggest day
of your lives--

271
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:40,765
<i>The Shelbyville game.</i>

272
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,529
<i>So lights out at 7::30...</i>

273
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:45,332
<i>and abstain from coffee,
tea and cola drinks.</i>

274
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:46,838
<i>They pack a wallop.</i>

275
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:47,999
Sure do, Skip.

276
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:50,008
Before I post
the starting lineup...

277
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:53,409
I want to assure those
who are not on the list...

278
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,573
that I'm very disappointed in you.

279
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,082
Something was lacking.

280
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,811
Let's call it heart.

281
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:00,978
<i>- No hustle either, Skip.
- That's right, Darryl.</i>

282
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:04,889
All right.

283
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,925
Way to go.

284
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:06,924
Aw, nuts.

285
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,119
Please, please, please.

286
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:10,129
Clemens, did I make the team?

287
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:11,129
You sure did.

288
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:12,130
I did?

289
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,632
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

290
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,133
In your face, Strawberry.

291
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:16,726
Are you Ken GriffeyJr.?

292
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:17,792
No.

293
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:19,634
Didn't mean
to get your hopes up.

294
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:22,256
Ohhh.

295
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,768
Smithers, there's no way
I can lose this bet...

296
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:37,430
unless, of course,
my nine all-stars...

297
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,769
fall victim to nine
separate misfortunes...

298
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:42,173
and are unable to play tomorrow.

299
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:43,972
But that will never happen.

300
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,774
Three misfortunes,
that's possible...

301
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:48,111
seven misfortunes,
there's an outside chance...

302
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:51,117
but nine misfortunes--
I'd like to see that.

303
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:53,745
What a nice little town.

304
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:56,688
Maybe I'll buy a home here
when I retire.

305
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:00,490
What seems to be
the problem, officers?

306
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,153
That's enough, smart guy.

307
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,663
Reach for your license.

308
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:05,958
Slowly.

309
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, well.

310
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:09,263
Steve Sax from New York City.

311
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,601
I heard some guy
got killed in New York...

312
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:13,731
and they never solved the case.

313
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:16,333
But you wouldn't know
anything about that...

314
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:17,844
now, would you, Steve?

315
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:19,743
But there's hundreds
of unsolved murders...

316
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:21,008
in New York City.

317
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:23,277
You don't know when
to keep your mouth shut...

318
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:24,648
do you, Saxy boy?

319
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:31,625
Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm.

320
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:34,820
Can't... lift... arm...

321
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:36,022
or... speak...

322
00:14:36,097 --> 00:14:39,089
at... normal... rate.

323
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,964
I'm afraid you have a case...

324
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:43,026
of acute radiation poisoning,
Mr. Scioscia.

325
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:44,230
Will... I...

326
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:45,431
be... able...

327
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:46,632
to... play...

328
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:49,107
softball... tomorrow?

329
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:51,437
No. By tomorrow...

330
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,844
you'll barely
be able to breathe.

331
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,314
Oh... man.

332
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:56,645
<i>Dr. Hibbert...</i>

333
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:59,777
Ken GriffeyJr. needs
to see you immediately.

334
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:02,652
We think it's an overdose
of nerve tonic.

335
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:04,554
Good Lord!

336
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,287
<i>Gigantism!</i>

337
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:11,256
- My baby! My baby!
- Don't worry, ma'am.

338
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,266
I'll save your baby.

339
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:18,003
Oh, thank you, Mr. Canseco.

340
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:20,302
<i>- My cat!</i>

341
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:23,537
Never fear, ma'am.
I'll save your cat.

342
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:30,146
<i>- My player piano!</i>

343
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:32,209
Oh, man.

344
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:38,687
Ohh, one thing I'm good at,
and I can't do it anymore.

345
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,819
Homie, you're good
at lots of things.

346
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:42,954
Like what?

347
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,224
Like snuggling.

348
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:48,029
Yeah, but none of my friends
can watch me.

349
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:50,036
<i>And I say...</i>

350
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:52,470
England's greatest
prime minister...

351
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,508
was Lord Palmerston!

352
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:55,701
Pitt, the Elder.

353
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,971
Lord Palmerston!

354
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,309
Pitt, the Elder!

355
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:02,645
Okay, you asked for it, Boggs.

356
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:03,843
Uh!

357
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:05,852
Yeah, that's
showing him, Barney.

358
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,046
Pitt, the Elder.

359
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:10,420
Lord Palmerston!

360
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,153
Nice work, boys.
We can close the book...

361
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:15,388
on every unsolved crime
in our fair city.

362
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:17,727
Don't I get to call my lawyer?

363
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:20,130
You watch too many movies, Sax.

364
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:24,364
<i>How long does it take
to see this thing?</i>

365
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:25,496
I'm in a hurry.

366
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,699
It's hard to say.

367
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:29,971
Once you go in,
you may never come out.

368
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:31,602
Wow! One, please.

369
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,812
Where do you think you're going?

370
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,822
To the game.

371
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:45,825
No. I don't want you to see me...

372
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:47,758
sitting on my worthless butt.

373
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:49,159
We've seen it, Dad.

374
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,459
For the last time,
get rid of those sideburns.

375
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:57,698
I don't know what you think
sideburns are, but--

376
00:16:57,772 --> 00:16:59,296
Don't argue with me!

377
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:01,170
Just get rid of them!

378
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:02,573
It's almost game time.

379
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:04,508
Where the devil are my ringers?

380
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,513
Mike Scioscia may not live
through the night.

381
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,845
Steve Sax is looking
at six life sentences.

382
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:12,647
Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished
off the face of the earth.

383
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,350
Cool!

384
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:18,016
What about Canseco?

385
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:22,626
The dryer goes on the right.

386
00:17:22,697 --> 00:17:24,631
Yes, ma'am.

387
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:25,757
What about Clemens?

388
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,597
Sir, he's in no condition to play.

389
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,966
That damn hypnotist!

390
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,871
You! Look what you've done.

391
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:37,376
My starting pitcher
thinks he's a chicken.

392
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:38,969
I'm going to report this...

393
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:41,014
to the American
Hypnotical Association.

394
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:43,676
<i>But I did a good job...</i>

395
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:45,946
a good job.

396
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,113
I guess it's not your fault.

397
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:49,349
<i>You did a good job.</i>

398
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:50,549
Mattingly!

399
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,957
I told you to trim
those sideburns.

400
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:55,188
Go home!

401
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:57,025
You're off the team!
For good!

402
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:58,156
Fine.

403
00:17:58,232 --> 00:18:00,166
I still like him
better than Steinbrenner.

404
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:02,794
All right, you ragtag
bunch of misfits.

405
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,464
<i>You hate me,
and I hate you even more.</i>

406
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:07,268
But without my beloved ringers...

407
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,399
you're all I've got.

408
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:10,410
So I want you to remember...

409
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:11,604
some inspiring things...

410
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,341
that someone else
may have told you...

411
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,406
in the course of your lives...

412
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,145
and go out there and win.

413
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,552
Not so fast, Simpson.

414
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,090
The man who plays
your position is here.

415
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,888
- Hit the pine.
- Ohhh!

416
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:31,724
You stink, Strawberry!

417
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,131
We want Home Run Homer!

418
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,567
Darryl.

419
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,867
Darryl.

420
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:40,270
- Darryl.
- Darryl.

421
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:41,603
- Darryl.
- Darryl.

422
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,667
Children,
that's not very nice.

423
00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:45,609
Mom, they're
professional athletes.

424
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,874
They're used to this.

425
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:48,972
It rolls
right off their backs.

426
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,346
Who wants peanuts?

427
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:55,548
Hey, whoa!

428
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:57,682
Ho, peanuts!
Hey, peanuts!

429
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:59,953
<i>We got peanuts!
Need some peanuts? Heads up!</i>

430
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:01,085
All right, Monty...

431
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:03,323
it's up to your
managerial skills.

432
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:04,523
What to do--

433
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:05,963
Smithers, massage my brain.

434
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,660
Yes, sir.

435
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:12,929
<i>You, Strawberry--
Hit a home run!</i>

436
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,599
Okay, Skip.

437
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,613
<i>I told him to do that.</i>

438
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:21,978
Brilliant strategy, sir.

439
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:25,982
Ohhh!

440
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:29,113
Oh, dear! Hmm.

441
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,452
Children, tell me...

442
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:33,391
when your father stops
scratching himself.

443
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:36,128
Kids?

444
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,721
We'll tell you, Mom.

445
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:39,732
<i>All right, tie game.</i>

446
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,859
<i>Bottom of the ninth.</i>

447
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:45,099
<i>Two outs, bases loaded.
Strawberry coming up.</i>

448
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:48,266
They're gonna win
the city championship.

449
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,037
No thanks to me.

450
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:51,043
Wait.

451
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:51,976
<i>You! Strawberry!</i>

452
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:53,172
Good effort today.

453
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:55,147
Take a lap
and hit the showers.

454
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:57,480
I'm putting in
a right-handed batter.

455
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:58,745
Pinch-hitting for me?

456
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,411
Yes. You're a left-hander...

457
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,353
and so is the pitcher.

458
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:04,357
If I send up
a right-handed batter...

459
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:06,188
it's called
playing the percentages.

460
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,490
It's what smart managers
do to win ball games.

461
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:10,427
I've got nine home runs.

462
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,489
You should be very proud.
Sit down.

463
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,898
Simpson!
You're batting for Strawberry.

464
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,095
I am? Whoo-hoo!

465
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,159
That a boy, Homer.

466
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:18,227
You can do it.

467
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,375
All right, Simpson.
Let's go over the signals.

468
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:24,968
- If I tug the bill of my cap like so...
- Yeah.

469
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:26,910
- it means the signal is a fake.
- Uh-huh.

470
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:30,382
- I can take that off
by dusting my hands thusly.
- Got it.

471
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,783
If I want you to bunt,
I'll touch my belt buckle...

472
00:20:32,853 --> 00:20:34,616
not once, not twice,
but thrice.

473
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:37,418
I don't understand
a word he's saying.

474
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:40,221
Why doesn't he just let me bat?

475
00:20:40,294 --> 00:20:44,628
I wish I was home with
a big bag of potato chips.

476
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:48,065
Mmm... potato chips.

477
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:50,069
- Got that, Simpson?
- Yes, sir.

478
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:54,733
Now batting for Darryl Strawberry--
Homer Simpson.

479
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:56,003
- All right!
- Yea!

480
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,407
- Boo!
- Boo!

481
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,852
Huh?

482
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:08,218
Ugh!

483
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:11,949
Oh, dear!

484
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:14,290
No, Mom.
It counts as a hit.

485
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:16,295
Dad just won the game.

486
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:18,297
Well, I guess he'll be happy...

487
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:20,333
when he comes to.

488
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:21,527
We won! We won!

489
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:22,933
All right!

490
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:30,336
Homer! Homer! Homer!
